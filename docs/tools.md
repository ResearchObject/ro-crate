# Tools

While we're mostly focusing on the [RO-Crate specification](specification.md) some tools already exist for working with RO-Crates:

 - [Describo](https://uts-eresearch.github.io/describo/) interactive desktop application to create, update and export RO-Crates for different profiles. (~ _beta_)
 - [CalcyteJS](https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/CalcyteJS) is a command-line tool to help create RO-Crates and HTML-readable rendering (~ _beta_)
 - [ro-crate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ro-crate) - JavaScript/NodeJS library for RO-Crate rendering as HTML. (~ _beta_)
 - [ro-crate-js](https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/ro-crate-js) - utility to render HTML from RO-Crate (~ _alpha_)
 - [ro-crate-ruby](https://github.com/fbacall/ro-crate-ruby) Ruby library to consume/produce RO-Crates (~ _alpha_)
 - [ro-crate-py](https://github.com/researchobject/ro-crate-py) Python library to consume/produce RO-Crates (~ _planning_)
