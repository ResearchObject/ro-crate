# Life Monitor

[Life Monitor](https://github.com/crs4/life_monitor) is a testing and monitoring service for computational workflows being developed as part of the [EOSC-Life](https://www.eosc-life.eu) project. It aims to facilitate the execution, monitoring and sharing of workflow tests over time, allowing to detect deviations from expected workflow operation and provide useful feedback to the workflow authors for maintaining and improving their work.

Life Monitor uses RO-Crate as an exchange format for the description of test suites associated with workflows. To this end, the Life Monitor team is developing [an extension to the Workflow RO-Crate specification](https://github.com/crs4/life_monitor/wiki/Workflow-Testing-RO-Crate) to support the inclusion of metadata related to the testing of computational workflows stored in the crate.
