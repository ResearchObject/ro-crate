# RO-Crate Profiles

While RO-Crates can be considered general-purpose containers of arbitrary data and open-ended metadata, in a practical use within a particular domain, application or framework, it will be benefitial to further constrain RO-Crate to a specific **profile**, a set of conventions, types and properties that one minimally can require and expect to be present in that subset of RO-Crates.

Defining and conforming to such a profile enables reliable programmatic consumption of RO-Crates, as well as their consistent creation, e.g. a user interface form can firmly suggest the required types and properties, and likewise a rendering of an RO-Crate can easier make rich UI components if it can reliably assume for instance that the [`Person`](1.1/contextual-entities.html#people) always has a `affiliation` to a [`Organization`](1.1/contextual-entities.html#organizations-as-values) which has a `url` - a restriction that may not be appropriate for all types of RO-Crates.

The RO-Crate profile can also lock down serialization expectation, for instance using a particular [version of RO-Crate](specification.html), [JSON-LD context](1.1/appendix/jsonld.html?highlight=@context#ro-crate-json-ld-context) or particular [packaging](1.1/appendix/implementation-notes.html#combining-with-other-packaging-schemes) like .zip or BagIt.

## Workflow RO-Crate

[Workflow RO-Crate](https://about.workflowhub.eu/Workflow-RO-Crate/) is a profile of RO-Crate 1.1, which requires at least one [data entity](1.1/data-entities.html) that is a [ComputationalWorkflow](1.1/workflows.html). This workflow must also be indicated with `mainEntity` from the [Root Data set](1.1/root-data-entity.html). The Workflow RO-Crate profile further recommends how to accompany the native workflow definition with a [abstract CWL description](https://www.commonwl.org/v1.2/Workflow.html#Operation), diagram, and meaning of named subfolders `test` and `examples`. 

Profiles can also provide recommendations, for instance Workflow RO-Crate has a list of recognized [workflow languages](https://about.workflowhub.eu/Workflow-RO-Crate/#supported-workflow-types) and licenses. Serialization of Workflow RO-Crates are restricted to ZIP archives and with a filename ending with `.crate.zip`.

This profile of RO-Crate is used by the [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/) both as downloadable archives of workflow entries and their metadata, but also for manual and programmatic upload of workflows, such as generated by [galaxy2cwl](https://github.com/workflowhub-eu/galaxy2cwl).  The associated services [Life Monitor](use_cases/life_monitor) and the workflow execution service [WfExS](https://github.com/inab/WfExS-backend) likewise access the Workflow RO-Crates through the hubs' implementation of the [Tool Registry Service API](https://about.workflowhub.eu/TRS/) to then pick up the tests and workflow to be executed.
