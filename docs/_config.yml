title: Research Object Crate (RO-Crate)
description: |
  RO-Crate is a community effort to establish a lightweight approach to
  packaging research data with their metadata. It is based on schema.org
  annotations in JSON-LD, and aims to make best-practice in formal metadata
  description accessible and practical for use in a wider variety of situations,
  from an individual researcher working with a folder of data, to large
  data-intensive computational research environments.
