# Galaxy

[![Galaxy logo](../../assets/img/galaxy.png)](https://galaxyproject.org)

[Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org) is a platform for FAIR data analysis which supports the building and execution of workflows. It has a broad user community spanning many domains, as well as a large collection of training resources contained within the [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org).

Galaxy can import and export RO-Crates for both regular datasets (following the base RO-Crate specification) and workflow executions (following the [Workflow Run Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/workflow-run-crate/profiles/workflow_run_crate/) profile). The [European Galaxy instance](<https://usegalaxy.eu>) uses RO-Crate as its export format by default.

The Galaxy platform also has integrations with the WorkflowHub workflow registry, RDM repositories such as InvenioRDM and Zenodo, and Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) providers such as eLabFTW and RSpace (related use cases: [WorkflowHub](workflowhub), [Electronic Lab Notebooks](eln)).

The Galaxy Training Network includes multiple hands-on RO-Crate tutorials as part of the [FAIR Data, Workflows and Research](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/fair/#st-ro-crate) topic. Further domain-specific training material is available for [RO-Crate in earth science](https://gxy.io/GTN:S00127) and [Annotated Research Contexts (ARCs) in plant science](https://gxy.io/GTN:T00466) (ARCs are a profile of RO-Crate used in the [DataPLANT](dataplant) project).

## Funding

The integration of RO-Crate features into Galaxy was funded by the [EuroScienceGateway](https://eurosciencegateway.eu) project. Development of training material was funded by [BY-COVID](https://by-covid.org), [EuroScienceGateway](https://eurosciencegateway.eu), [DataPLANT](https://nfdi4plants.github.io), and the [German Research Foundation](https://www.dfg.de/en).
