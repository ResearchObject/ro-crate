# Autosubmit

[Autosubmit](https://autosubmit.readthedocs.io/en/master/) is an
experiment and workflow manager that is able to produce Workflow
Run RO-Crate files. Before Autosubmit adopted RO-Crate, the
provenance of workflow runs was available but was it was not
standardized, consisting of configuration and trace files
compressed into a single archive file.

Now, Autosubmit produces a ZIP file with the same content as before,
but it also includes the top level RO-Crate JSON-LD file. In this file
users can find data annotated with persistent identifiers (PID),
and following a pre-defined schema, which makes it not only human-
but also machine-actionable.

The most common use cases for Autosubmit are climate and weather
workflows executed in HPC environments, like
[BSC's MareNostrum](https://www.bsc.es/marenostrum/marenostrum).
The execution logs include metrics from models, Slurm jobs, energy usage,
dependency versions, and more. Now more accessible through RO-Crate.
