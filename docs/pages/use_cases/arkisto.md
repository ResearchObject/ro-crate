# Arkisto

Arkisto was a project website that aimed to outline a principled approach to research data management. The site is no longer being maintained.

The work done on Arkisto has been developed into a set of protocols: Protocols for Implementing Long-term Archival Repositories Services (PILARS) <http://w3id.org/ldac/pilars>. See the [RRKive](rrkive) and [PILARS](pilars) pages for more information.

Arkisto was built on top of Research Object Crate (RO-Crate) and the Oxford Common File System Layout (OCFL).
