## Arkisto

Arkisto was a project website that aimed to outline a principled approach to research data management. This site is no longer being maintained.

The work done on Arkisto has been developed into a set of protocols: Protocols for Implementing Long-term Archival Repositories Services (PILARS) <http://w3id.org/ldac/pilars> with some more detail available at [RRKive.org](rrkive).

Arkisto was built on top of Research Object Crate (RO-Crate) and the Oxford Common File System Layout (OCFL).
