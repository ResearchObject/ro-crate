# RRKive


The RRKive site, managed by the Language Data Commons of Australia collects resources related to implementing Archival Repository ([RRKive](https://rkive.org/)) solutions based on a set of Protocols know as the PILARS: Principles for Implementing Long-term Archival Repository Services. https://w3id.org/ldac/pilars. RRkive is built on RO-Crate as a way to describe data objects for long term archiving.

RRKive is a replacement for [Arkisto](arkisto).
