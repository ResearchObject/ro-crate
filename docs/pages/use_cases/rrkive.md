# RRKive


The RRKive site, managed by the Language Data Commons of Australia collects resources related to implementing Archival Repository (RRKive) solutions as part of a Data Commons based on a set of Protocols know as the PILARS: Principles for Implementing Long-term Archival Repository Services. https://w3id.org/ldac/pilars

The PILARS are maintained as stand-alone project managed in a Git repository.
