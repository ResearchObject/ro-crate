# Reproducible XAFS Analyses

![ReXAFS logo](../assets/img/ReXAFS.png)

The [Reproducible XAFS Analyses Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/rexas/records) groups Galaxy RO-Crates containing workflows and data for the reproduction of published papers which contain X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analyses.

As of November 2024, the team has reproduced published results from nine papers in the area of Catalysis. The original analyses were reproduced using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) Galaxy tools developed by the [Scientific Computing Department](https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/home.aspx) at [STFC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/stfc/), as part of the [PSDI](https://www.psdi.ac.uk) project.

RO-Crates exported from Galaxy have been published to the Zenodo community as part of the research data submitted for the paper: **Use of scientific workflows to support the processing and analysis of catalysis research data from XAFS experiments** (Under review). 

The team will keep on adding more RO-Crates from examples relevant to the catalysis domain. 

Tutorials have also been developed to train researchers in reproducing XAFS analyses using Galaxy and RO-Crate (see resources below).
