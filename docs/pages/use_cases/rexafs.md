# Reproducible XAFS Analyses

The [Reproducible XAFS Analyses Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/rexas/records) groups Galaxy RO-Crates containing workflows and data for the reproduction of published papers which contain X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analyses.

As of November 2024, the team has reproduced published results from nine papers in the area of Catalysis. The original analyses were reproduced using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) Galaxy tools developed by the [Scientific Computing Department](https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/home.aspx) at [STFC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/stfc/) as part of the [PSDI](https://www.psdi.ac.uk) project, with the [UK Catalysis Hub](https://www.ukcatalysishub.org) providing the use cases and gathering the data used.

RO-Crates exported from Galaxy have been published to the Zenodo community as part of the research data submitted for the paper: **Use of scientific workflows to support the processing and analysis of catalysis research data from XAFS experiments** (Under review). 

The team will keep on adding more RO-Crates from examples relevant to the catalysis domain. 

[Tutorials](https://xerte.cardiff.ac.uk/play_22679#PG1732791153760) have also been developed to train researchers in reproducing XAFS analyses using Galaxy and RO-Crate.
