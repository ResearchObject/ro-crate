# Lab Integrated Data (LabID)

[![LabID logo](../../assets/img/labid.png)](https://labid-demo.embl.de/home)

LabID is an all-in-one FAIR data management platform for life sciences institutes, developed at the EMBL Heidelberg ([MODIS](https://www.embl.org/groups/modis/)).  
It allows keeping track of datasets, samples, and inventory, while featuring an Electronic Lab Notebook.  

The workflow integration of LabID also facilitates collaborative workflow development and versioning, as well as keeping track of workflow executions.
Workflows and workflow runs can be imported and exported from various sources including Galaxy, WorkflowHub and Git repositories.  

LabID takes advantage of the [Workflow RO-Crate](https://about.workflowhub.eu/Workflow-RO-Crate/) and [Workflow Run RO-Crate profiles](https://www.researchobject.org/workflow-run-crate/profiles/) to import workflows from [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/), and export workflows and workflow runs to other platforms.
