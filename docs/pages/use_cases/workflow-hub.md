title: WorkflowHub
description: WorkflowHub imports and exports Workflow RO-Crates, using it as an exchange format. They are a specialization of RO-Crate for packaging an executable workflow with all necessary documentation. It is aligned with, and intends to strictly extend, the more general Bioschemas ComputationalWorkflow profile.

## WorkflowHub
[WorkflowHub](https://about.workflowhub.eu/) is a registry for describing, sharing and publishing scientific computational workflows.

WorkflowHub aims to facilitate discovery and re-use of workflows in an accessible and interoperable way. This is achieved through extensive use of open standards and tools, including CWL, RO-Crate, Bioschemas and GA4GH's TRS API, in accordance with the FAIR principles.

WorkflowHub supports workflows of any type in its native repository.
