# DeSci Nodes

The [DeSci Nodes](https://docs.desci.com/) system has been developed by the [DeSci foundation](https://www.descifoundation.org/), where [dPID](https://www.dpid.org/) (distibuted Persistent Identifier) act  as an overlay of the Interplanetary File System (IPFS).

Users can interact with the DeSci platform for building and publishing Research Objects, and the [DeSci metadata](https://docs.desci.com/learn/open-state-repository/metadata) are exposed as a [detached RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.2-DRAFT/structure.html#detached-ro-crate) with IPFS references (see [example dPID](https://beta.dpid.org/46?jsonld)). 

DeSci Nodes have documented a [FAIR Implementation Profile](https://docs.desci.com/learn/fair-data/fair-compliance/desci-nodes-fip) (FIP) documenting compliance with FAIR principles.
