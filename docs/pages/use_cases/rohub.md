# ROHub

[![ROHub logo](assets/img/ro_hub.svg)](https://reliance.rohub.org/)

[ROHub](https://reliance.rohub.org/) (Research Object Hub), one of [EOSC](https://eosc.eu/) research enabling services, is a holistic solution for the storage, lifecycle management and preservation of scientific work and operational processes via research objects. It makes these resources available to others, allows to publish and release them through a DOI, and allows to discover and reuse pre-existing scientific knowledge. 

ROHub is a reference platform implementing natively the full [Research Object (RO) model](https://www.researchobject.org/specs/) and paradigm, which provides the backbone to a wealth of RO-centric applications and interfaces across different scientific communities.

ROHub imports and exports RO-Crates, using it as an exchange format, and is integrated with or leverages other EOSC services (e.g., EOSC AAI ([EGI Check-In](https://www.egi.eu/services/check-in/)) to enable SSO across different EOSC services, export and dissemination of research objects in other EOSC repositories/services ([Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), [B2Share](https://b2share.eudat.eu/)), use of storage systems/services provided by EOSC to enable larger scalability ([B2drop](https://www.eudat.eu/services/b2drop)), and connection with computational services ([EGI Notebooks](https://www.egi.eu/services/notebooks/)). 

Additionally, as part of [RELIANCE project](https://www.reliance-project.eu/), ROHub is being integrated with [data cubes](https://reliance-eosc.github.io/reliance-ro-crate/) services to facilitate access and reuse of large geospatial data.

ROHub functionalities can be used via the [Web portal](https://reliance.rohub.org/) and via the provided [Python library](https://reliance-eosc.github.io/ROHUB-API_documentation/html/).

## RO-Crate in ROHub API

The [ROHub API](https://api.rohub.org/api/) provides support for [upload](https://api.rohub.org/api/redoc/#operation/ros_upload), [export](https://api.rohub.org/api/redoc/#operation/ros_crate_export_to_crate) and [customized download](https://api.rohub.org/api/redoc/#operation/ros_crate_download_read). 

In addition, publication of an RO to Zenodo/B2Share ([evolution](https://api.rohub.org/api/redoc/#operation/ros_evolution) to `ARCHIVE`) uses RO-Crate for archival purposes.

The API uses [content-negotiation](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-3.4) for different content types.

Example, for `application/ld+json` gives the RO-Crate Metadata file:

```
curl -H "Accept: application/ld+json" https://api.rohub.org/api/ros/b83a814a-27e6-499c-a6b2-61a0a921e53b/crate/download/

{
  "@context": { … },
  "@graph": [
   …
    {
      "@id": "./",
      "identifier": "https://w3id.org/ro-id/b83a814a-27e6-499c-a6b2-61a0a921e53b",
      "hasPart": […],
      "@type": [
        "Dataset",
        "http://w3id.org/ro/earth-scienceExecutableResearchObject",
        "http://purl.org/wf4ever/ro#ResearchObject",
        "http://purl.org/wf4ever/roevo#ArchiveRO"
      ],
   …
}
```

For `application/zip` as a zipped RO-Crate:

```
$ curl -f -o crate.zip -H "Accept: application/zip" https://api.rohub.org/api/ros/b83a814a-27e6-499c-a6b2-61a0a921e53b/crate/download/
