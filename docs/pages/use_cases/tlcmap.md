# Time Layered Cultural Map (TLCMap)

> The Time-layered Cultural Map of Australia (TLCMap) is an online research platform
funded by the Australian Research Council Linkage Infrastructure, Equipment and 
Facilities (LIEF) grant scheme in 2019 and currently under development. When completed, 
it will deliver researcher-driven national-scale infrastructure for the humanities,
focused on mapping, time series, and data integration, and will expand the use of Australian cultural and historical data for research through sharply defined and powerful
discovery mechanisms. 
>
> The main function of TLCMap is to generate web-based digital time-maps from spatiotemporal data for humanitiesâ€™ needs, including time, layering, data, text, media, and
virtual reality applications. Linking geo-spatial maps of Australian cultural and historical information, adapted to time series, represents a significant contribution to humanities research in Australia. For researchers, including those without extensive technical
backgrounds, it has the potential to transform access to data and to visualisation tools
and open new perspectives on Australian culture and history. For the public, it will
enable increased accessibility to historical and cultural data through visualisations created by researchers and made available online and in print. [[1]](#tlcmap-paper)

TLCMap uses RO-Crate for exporting geographical search results and map layers via the Gazeteer of Historical Australian Places (GHAP) service.

## RO-Crate Export


Below is an example of a search for "Katoomba" (the name of a town in New South Wales), which returns a zip file containing csv, kml, and geojson files.

```
curl "https://ghap.tlcmap.org/places?containsname=katoomba&searchausgaz=on&searchncg=on&searchpublicdatasets=on&format=rocrate&download=on"
