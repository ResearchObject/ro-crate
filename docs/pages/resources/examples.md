1. TOC
{:toc}

The [RO-Crate structure](specification/1.1/structure) is that a _RO-Crate root_ directory has a _RO-Crate Metadata File_ named `ro-crate-metadata.json` that describe the other files, directories and URLs; as well as relating them to things in the world (e.g. people, instruments).

{: .note }
> From RO-Crate 1.1 `ro-crate-metadata.jsonld` was renamed `ro-crate-metadata.json`.

The [specification](specification) has several inline examples:
 * [Skeleton ro-crate-metadata.json](specification/1.1/root-data-entity#ro-crate-metadata-file-descriptor)
 * [Minimal example](specification/1.1/root-data-entity#minimal-example-of-ro-crate)
 * [Example with files](specification/1.1/data-entities#example-linking-to-a-file-and-folders)
 * [Example with web resources](specification/1.1/data-entities#web-based-data-entities)
 * [Example with file, author, location](specification/1.1/appendix/jsonld)
 * [Example with computational workflow](specification/1.1/workflows#complete-workflow-example)
 * [RO-Crate specification](specification/1.1/ro-crate-preview) ([ro-crate-metadata.jsonld](specification/1.1/ro-crate-metadata.jsonld)) – the specification itself and its publication

The [RO-Crate 1.1](specification/1.1/) specification is largely **explained by examples** by showing additional fragments:
 * [Data entities](specification/1.1/data-entities) (files, folders)
 * [Web resources](specification/1.1/data-entities#web-based-data-entities)
 * [Contextual entities](specification/1.1/contextual-entities) such as [people](specification/1.1/contextual-entities#people), [organizations](specification/1.1/contextual-entities#organizations-as-values), [citations](specification/1.1/contextual-entities#publications-via-citation-property), [licensing](specification/1.1/contextual-entities#licensing-access-control-and-copyright), [places](specification/1.1/contextual-entities#places)
 * Section on [provenance](specification/1.1/provenance) details how the creation of resources can be recorded
 * [Computational workflows and scripts](specification/1.1/workflows) can be further described showing programming language, inputs, outputs, etc.
 * The RO-Crate [JSON-LD can be extended](specification/1.1/appendix/jsonld#extending-ro-crate) for additional vocabularies, including [ad-hoc](specification/1.1/appendix/jsonld#adding-new-or-ad-hoc-vocabulary-terms) terms
 * Section on [combining with other packaging schemas](specification/1.1/appendix/implementation-notes#combining-with-other-packaging-schemes) explain how an RO-Crate can be packaged in a single archive using BagIt

## UTS examples

The [Arkisto platform case studies](https://arkisto-platform.github.io/case-studies/) highlight multiple ways RO-Crate has been used:
* [PARADISEC](https://arkisto-platform.github.io/case-studies/paradisec/) (the Pacific And Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures) deployed on <http://mod.paradisec.org.au/> (example [ro-crate-metadata.json](http://mod.paradisec.org.au/repository/72/b3/dc/14/01/c8/ff/06/aa/cb/a0/99/0a/12/8f/c1/13/cf/9a/d5/27/5f/49/4b/05/c1/14/21/77/35/65/61/bd/7f/4c/0e/88/00/ba/de/2c/bb/be/d7/5f/6d/9d/01/98/94/73/5a/d7/e4/07/62/68/4d/24/3a/44/2d/65/8a/v1/content/ro-crate-metadata.json) via OCFL)
* [Recordings in South Efate](http://mod.paradisec.org.au/view/NT1/98007?version=v1) ([ro-crate-metadata.jsonld](http://mod.paradisec.org.au/repository/72/b3/dc/14/01/c8/ff/06/aa/cb/a0/99/0a/12/8f/c1/13/cf/9a/d5/27/5f/49/4b/05/c1/14/21/77/35/65/61/bd/7f/4c/0e/88/00/ba/de/2c/bb/be/d7/5f/6d/9d/01/98/94/73/5a/d7/e4/07/62/68/4d/24/3a/44/2d/65/8a/v1/content/ro-crate-metadata.json)) – one of [more than 470 RO-Crates](http://mod.paradisec.org.au/) from the [Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures](http://www.paradisec.org.au/) _(beta)_

The [UTS Research Data Portal](https://data.research.uts.edu.au/) includes several RO-Crates:
* [A room impulse response database for multizone sound field reproduction](https://doi.org/10.26195/0wx8-v473) 
* [PCFA Telenursing eResource](https://data.research.uts.edu.au/publication/60145760e2d511ec87d63dd96ff2e9f4/)


## WorkflowHub examples

The <https://workflowhub.eu/> accepts upload by RO-Crate and generates RO-Crate to improve reproducability of computational workflow that follow the [Workflow RO-Crate profile](https://about.workflowhub.eu/Workflow-RO-Crate/), see also [RO-Crate section on workflows](specification/1.1/workflows).

Workflows can be exported from Workflow Hub as RO-Crates, e.g. [a Galaxy workflow](https://workflowhub.eu/workflows/22/ro_crate?version=1). Workflows can also be navigated programmatically using the [TRS API](https://about.workflowhub.eu/TRS/), e.g. <https://workflowhub.eu/ga4gh/trs/v2/tools/26/versions/1/PLAIN_CWL/descriptor/ro-crate-metadata.json>

## Biocompute Object

<https://github.com/biocompute-objects/bco-ro-example-chipseq> hosts an example RO-Crate ([ro-crate-metadata.json](https://rawcdn.githack.com/biocompute-objects/bco-ro-example-chipseq/76cb84c8d6a17a3fd7ae3102f68de3f780458601/data/ro-crate-metadata.json), [ro-crate-preview.html](https://rawcdn.githack.com/biocompute-objects/bco-ro-example-chipseq/76cb84c8d6a17a3fd7ae3102f68de3f780458601/data/ro-crate-preview.html)) that capture a [BioCompute Object](https://www.biocomputeobject.org/) (IEEE 2791) using [BagIt](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.1/appendix/implementation-notes.html#adding-ro-crate-to-bagit).  See the tutorial [Create an BCO RO-Crate](https://biocompute-objects.github.io/bco-ro-crate/tutorial/) for step-by-step details.
