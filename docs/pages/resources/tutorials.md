* The Carpentries-style tutorial [Packaging Data with RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/packaging_data_with_ro-crate/) guides you through constructing a simple RO-Crate.
* The [Galaxy Smörgåsbord 2023](https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/events/smorgasbord3/) module [FAIR data and provenance with RO-Crate and Galaxy](https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/modules/ro-crate) has further learning material:
  * [An overview of the RO-Crate concept and its implementations](https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/videos/ro-crates/intro/slides): [[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GYdN5B1tc8)] (17 min), [[slides/transcripts](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7828632)]
  * [RO-Crate - Introduction](https://training.galaxyproject.org/topics/fair/tutorials/ro-crate-intro/tutorial.html): guides you through constructing a simple RO-Crate, similar to the Carpentries-style tutorial above
  * [RO-Crate in Python](https://training.galaxyproject.org/topics/fair/tutorials/ro-crate-in-python/tutorial.html): introduces the [`rocrate`](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate-py) Python package which can be used to construct, edit, and read RO-Crates
  * [Workflow Run RO-Crate introduction](https://training.galaxyproject.org/topics/fair/tutorials/ro-crate-workflow-run-ro-crate/tutorial.html): guides you through constructing an RO-Crate which captures an execution of a computational workflow.
