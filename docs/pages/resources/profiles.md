While RO-Crates can be considered general-purpose containers of arbitrary data and open-ended
metadata, in practical use within a particular domain, application or framework, it will be
beneficial to further constrain RO-Crate to a specific **profile**: a set of conventions, types and
properties that one minimally can require and expect to be present in that subset of RO-Crates.

Defining and conforming to such a profile enables reliable programmatic consumption of an RO-Crate's
content, as well as consistent creation, e.g. a form in a user interface form firmly suggest the
required types and properties, and likewise a rendering of an RO-Crate can easier make rich UI
components if it can reliably assume for instance that the
[`Person`](specification/1.1/contextual-entities#people) always has a `affiliation` to a
[`Organization`](specification/1.1/contextual-entities#organizations-as-values) which has a `url` - a
restriction that may not be appropriate for all types of RO-Crates.

The RO-Crate profile can also lock down serialization expectation, for instance using a particular
[version of RO-Crate](specification),
[JSON-LD context](specification/1.1/appendix/jsonld?highlight=@context#ro-crate-json-ld-context) or
particular
[packaging](specification/1.1/appendix/implementation-notes#combining-with-other-packaging-schemes) like .zip
or BagIt.

For more examples, see the section
[Profiles of RO-Crate in use](https://www.researchobject.org/2021-packaging-research-artefacts-with-ro-crate/manuscript.html#inuse)
in the recent RO-Crate paper.

## Workflow RO-Crate profile

[Workflow RO-Crate](https://w3id.org/workflowhub/workflow-ro-crate/) is a profile of RO-Crate 1.1,
which requires at least one [data entity](specification/1.1/data-entities) that is a
[ComputationalWorkflow](specification/1.1/workflows). This workflow must also be indicated with `mainEntity`
from the [Root Data set](specification/1.1/root-data-entity). The Workflow RO-Crate profile further
recommends how to accompany the native workflow definition with a
[abstract CWL description](https://www.commonwl.org/v1.2/Workflow#Operation), diagram, and
meaning of named subfolders `test` and `examples`.

Profiles can also provide recommendations, for instance Workflow RO-Crate has a list of recognized
[workflow languages](https://about.workflowhub.eu/Workflow-RO-Crate/#supported-workflow-types) and
licenses. Serialization of Workflow RO-Crates are restricted to ZIP archives and with a filename
ending with `.crate.zip`.

This profile of RO-Crate is used by the [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/) both as downloadable
archives of workflow entries and their metadata, but also for manual and programmatic upload of
workflows, such as generated by [galaxy2cwl](https://github.com/workflowhub-eu/galaxy2cwl). The
associated service [Life Monitor](life-monitor) uses the profile as a submission format for
workflow test suites, and the workflow execution service
[WfExS](https://github.com/inab/WfExS-backend) accesses Workflow RO-Crates through the hubs'
implementation of the [Tool Registry Service API](https://about.workflowhub.eu/TRS/) to pick up the
workflow to be executed.

In summary the _Workflow RO-Crate profile_ covers as of 2021-03-09:

    -   `"@id": "#nextflow"`
    -   `"@id": "#snakemake"`

An experimental
[Profile Crate](https://about.workflowhub.eu/Workflow-RO-Crate/ro-crate-preview) has been
created in preparation for
[formalized RO-Crate profiles](specification/1.2/profiles) in RO-Crate 1.2.

### Workflow Testing RO-Crate profile

[Workflow Testing RO-Crate](https://lifemonitor.eu/workflow_testing_ro_crate) is a specialization of
Workflow RO-Crate used by [Life Monitor](life-monitor) to support the submission of test
suites for computational workflows.

This profile is an [RO-Crate extension](specification/1.1/appendix/jsonld#extending-ro-crate) that employs
additional terms from the
[ro-terms test namespace](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-terms/tree/master/test):

```json
[
    "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1/context",
    {
        "TestSuite": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#TestSuite",
        "TestInstance": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#TestInstance",
        "TestService": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#TestService",
        "TestDefinition": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#TestDefinition",
        "PlanemoEngine": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#PlanemoEngine",
        "JenkinsService": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#JenkinsService",
        "TravisService": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#TravisService",
        "GithubService": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#GithubService",
        "instance": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#instance",
        "runsOn": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#runsOn",
        "resource": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#resource",
        "definition": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#definition",
        "engineVersion": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#engineVersion"
    }
]
```

The most recent version of the context is at
<https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-terms/tree/master/test>.

A Workflow Testing RO-Crate is essentially a Workflow RO-Crate with additional specification on how
to structure test suites and refer to them from the root dataset:

```json
{
    "@id": "./",
    "@type": "Dataset",
    "mentions": [
        {
            "@id": "#test1"
        },
        {
            "@id": "#test2"
        }
    ],
    ...
}
```

More details are available from the [spec page](https://lifemonitor.eu/workflow_testing_ro_crate).

### Workflow Run Crate

[Workflow Run Crate working group](https://www.researchobject.org/workflow-run-crate/) have
developed [three profile](https://www.researchobject.org/workflow-run-crate/profiles) to capture the
**provenance** of execution provenance of computational workflows and scripts. Join the
[RO-Crate community](community) to help contribute!

-   [Process Run Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/wfrun/process) can be used to describe the execution of
    one or more tools that contribute to the same computation;
-   [Workflow Run Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/wfrun/workflow) is similar to Process Run Crate, but
    assumes that the coordinated execution of the tools is driven by a computational workflow
-   [Provenance Run Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/wfrun/provenance) extends Workflow Run Crate with
    guidelines for describing the internal details of each step of the workflow.

### Common Provenance Model RO-Crate profile

The Common Provenance Model ([CPM](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01537-6)) provides a baseline
for distributed provenance chains based on W3C PROV. The
[Common Provenance Model RO-Crate profile](https://w3id.org/cpm/ro-crate) specifies how to identify
and handle CPM compliant provenance files and CPM compliant meta-provenance files in an RO-Crate. It
is compatible with the Workflow Run Crate profile.

## Describo profiles

[Describo](https://describo.github.io/#/) makes available all of Schema.org by default but users can
also choose a pre-defined profile including an RO-Crate v1.1 profile, which informs the user
interface which entity types and properties should be offered and requested when a user is editing
an RO-Crate.

The
[RO Crate profile](https://github.com/describo/profiles/tree/master/domain-profiles/ResearchObject-Crate)
covers the recommendations in [RO-Crate 1.1 specifications](specification/1.1/), adding UI details such as value
type, labels and description for each field.

In addition, a [Domain-specific profile](https://github.com/describo/profiles#profile-documentation)
can be created as JSON and used by Describo to customize the selection of types and properties,
including adding additional [schema.org](http://schema.org/) types, third-party vocabularies and
inline ad-hoc term definitions.

In summary the _default profile_ covers:

-   [`Dataset`](http://schema.org/Dataset) (e.g.
    [RO-Crate Root](specification/1.1/root-data-entity#direct-properties-of-the-root-data-entity))
    -   [`name`](specification/1.1/root-data-entity#direct-properties-of-the-root-data-entity): `Text`
        (required)
    -   [`description`](specification/1.1/root-data-entity#direct-properties-of-the-root-data-entity): `Text`
    -   [`license`](specification/1.1/contextual-entities#licensing-access-control-and-copyright):
        [`CreativeWork`](http://schema.org/CreativeWork)
    -   [`datePublished`](specification/1.1/root-data-entity#direct-properties-of-the-root-data-entity):
        `Date`
    -   [`publisher`](specification/1.1/contextual-entities#publisher): `Publisher` (required; ad-hoc type?
    -   [`hasPart`](specification/1.1/data-entities#referencing-files-and-folders-from-the-root-data-entity):
        `(File|Dataset|Workflow|RepositoryCollection|RepositoryObject)`

## RELIANCE RO-crate profile

[RELIANCE RO-Crates](https://reliance-eosc.github.io/reliance-ro-crate/) are a specialization of
RO-Crate for packaging **data cubes** enabling access earth observation data, along with all the
necessary and other related artifacts like documentation, images, related infrastructures, etc.

The [RELIANCE project](https://reliance-project.eu/) uses RELIANCE RO-Crates as an exchange format
to package data cubes in Earth Science, used as import/export by the [ROHub](rohub)
portal.

## Paradisec profile

The
[PARADISEC Describo profile](https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/describo/blob/master/src/components/profiles/paradisec.describo.profile.json)
is built in to [Describo](#describo-profiles) and is the basis for the
[PARADISEC](https://arkisto-platform.github.io/case-studies/paradisec/) RO-Crates exposed in the
[Modern PARADISEC demonstrator](https://mod.paradisec.org.au/) to annotate and expose digital
cultural heritage records.

In summary the _PARADISEC profile_ covers as of
[Describo 0.13.0](https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/describo/blob/v0.13.0/src/components/profiles/paradisec.describo.profile.json):

-   [`Collection`](http://schema.org/Collection)

This is a good example of how a specific profile can guide a user interface and
[extend RO-Crate](specification/1.1/appendix/jsonld#extending-ro-crate) with additional terms.

_Note that some RO-Crates in the [Modern PARADISEC demonstrator](https://mod.paradisec.org.au/) have
evolved from this profile to conform with RO-Crate 1.1's
[repository content types](specification/1.1/provenance#digital-library-and-repository-content)_

## ARC RO-Crate profile

The [ARC RO-Crate profile](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/arc-ro-crate-profile) describes [Annotated Research Contexts](https://arc-rdm.org/) (ARC), developed by [DataPLANT](https://nfdi4plants.org/).
An ARC consists of [ISA](https://isa-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/isamodel.html) metadata describing the experimental setup and computational workflows given in CWL.
The current profile is a combination of the [ISA RO-Crate profile](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/isa-ro-crate-profile) and the [ARC CWL RO-Crate profile](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/arc-cwl-ro-crate-profile), see details below.
It requires the crate to follow the ISA Investigation profile on the top level.
The investigation object contains studies and assays from the ISA model, as well as computational workflows.
The core entity of both sub-profiles is the type `LabProcess` defined by [Bioschemas](https://bioschemas.org/), which is used to describe processes leading to data files in a parametrized way.

How such an RO-Crate can be generated from an ARC is described in the [arc-to-rocrate](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/arc-to-rocrate) repository, which also contains scripts to perform the conversion.

## ISA RO-Crate Profile

The [ISA RO-Crate profile](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/arc-to-rocrate/blob/main/profiles/investigation.md) describes experimental data in plant sciences that is annotated by metadata following the [ISA model](https://isa-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/isamodel.html).
Such datasets consist of three types of data entities: `Investigation`, `Study` and `Assay`.
The profile adds requirements of the crate such that the data folders match the Investigation, Study and Assay objects of the [ISA model](https://isa-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/isamodel.html).
The description of experimental processes that produce the data uses the [Bioschemas](https://bioschemas.org/) type `LabProcess` as its core entity.
It describes how data and samples are derived from each other in a graph model based on formalized parameters as key-value pairs.
Profiles for all included types can be found in the [full version](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/isa-ro-crate-profile).

## ARC CWL RO-Crate Profile

The [ARC CWL RO-Crate profile](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/arc-cwl-ro-crate-profile) extends the existing [Workflow Run Crate profile](https://w3id.org/ro/wfrun/workflow/) in an ARC-specific context.
It uses the same process graph types (`LabProtocol`,`LabProcess`) as the [ISA profile](#isa-ro-crate-profile) to further annotate parameters of workflows (equivalent to protocols in ISA) and runs (equivalent to processes in ISA).  

## Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN)

The [ELN file format](eln) has been defined as an archive format to capture Electronic Laboratory Notebooks (ELN).  The file format is a ZIP file with an embedded `ro-crate-metadata.json`. ELN is implemented by [eLabFTW](https://www.elabftw.net/), [Rspace](https://www.researchspace.com/) and other lab note book tools.


## RO-Crates-and-Excel

[RO-Crates-and-Excel](https://github.com/e11938258/RO-Crates-and-Excel/) is a profile describing
data of an Microsoft Excel spreadsheet within an RO-Crate, along with a converter tool.

This profile has been expressed
[for Describo](https://github.com/e11938258/RO-Crates-and-Excel/blob/main/profile/profile.json) and
adds keys like `number_of_rows`, `stdev`, `average_length`.

_Note that this profile has not currently been updated to
[use JSON-LD terms](specification/1.1/appendix/jsonld#adding-new-or-ad-hoc-vocabulary-terms)_.

## Making an RO-Crate profile

As a starting point, an RO-Crate profile can be written down in structured human language, as
exemplified by [Workflow RO-Crate](https://about.workflowhub.eu/Workflow-RO-Crate/).

Consistent use of the key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT,
RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119) makes
explicit what is a strict requirement of the profile, what are best practice recommendations, and
what are open-ended extensions.

New profiles can use any <https://schema.org/> terms, but are likely to need define or import
[additional terms](specification/1.1/appendix/jsonld#adding-new-or-ad-hoc-vocabulary-terms)
that needs to be mapped in the `@context`.

A more formal definition of the profile can take multiple forms, depending on the serialization
requirements for the RO-Crate, and how open-ended or restricted the profile is intended to be:

-   [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) requiring a restricted JSON form of
    [RO-Crate JSON-LD](specification/1.1/appendix/jsonld). May include restricted JSON forms for expressing
    selected [data](specification/1.1/data-entities) and [contextual entities](specification/1.1/contextual-entities)
    in a certain way.
-   RDF Shapes expressed in [ShEx](https://shex.io/) or [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) to
    check graph patterns like _`author` must be of `@type: Person` and have `affiliation` to a
    `@type: Organization` that has a `url` to a valid URL_
-   Hard-coded validator, e.g. checking expected folders like `test/` exists or that a file really
    is of declared media type.

Implementors making validators may also want to first check that the
[RO-Crate metadata file](specification/1.1/structure#ro-crate-metadata-file-ro-crate-metadatajson) is:

-   Valid [JSON](https://www.json.org/)
-   Has expected/supported JSON-LD `@context`
-   Valid JSON-LD Compacted form
-   Valid [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/)
-   Valid RDF triples
-   Correct use of schema.org types/properties

Depending on requirements it may be beneficial to combine these approaches - for instance a
hard-coded validator can rely on structural RO-Crate JSON checks before inspecting a particular data
item in detail.

## Formalizing RO-Crate profiles

Currently an RO-Crate profile is in the form of an informal documentation for humans rather than
machine-readable.

Version 1.2 of the RO-Crate specification
[formalizes RO-Crate profiles](specification/1.2/profiles) as a **Profile Crate** - an RO-Crate that defines
the profile. See the
[Workflow Profile Crate](https://about.workflowhub.eu/Workflow-RO-Crate/ro-crate-preview.html) as
example.
