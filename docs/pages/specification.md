# RO-Crate Specification

The RO-Crate 1.1 specification has been **released**.

{% comment %} 
The links below use the `{{ baseurl }}{% link _specification/<version>/index.md %}` format to avoid problems with using the relative path "specification/<version>" within this page when serving the site locally.
It's something to do with this page being rendered to specification/index.html and Jekyll getting muddled with the relative URIs. 
Other pages are fine and can use the simpler `specification/<version>` path.

* **[RO-Crate 1.1]({{ baseurl }}{% link _specification/1.1/index.md %})** **(newest release)**
* [RO-Crate 1.2-DRAFT]({{ baseurl }}{% link _specification/1.2-DRAFT/index.md %}) (draft for next release)
* [RO-Crate 1.0]({{ baseurl }}{% link _specification/1.0/index.md %}) 
* [RO-Crate 0.2]({{ baseurl }}{% link _specification/0.2/index.md %})
* [DataCrate 1.0](https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/datacrate/blob/ba37cc707d48d3569663ab04f9d4f5c25dac6e34/spec/1.0/data_crate_specification_v1.0.md)
* [ROLite Draft 0.1.0]({{ baseurl }}{% link _specification/0.1.0/index.md %}) 

_Historical note_: After the initial draft, the community decided to base the specification on [DataCrate](https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/datacrate/), and changed the name from _ROLite_ to **RO-Crate**.
