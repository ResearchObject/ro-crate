This folder has the [MarkDown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown) content that is rendered to <https://researchobject.github.io/ro-crate/> by [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

A file like [pages/about/background.md](pages/about/background.md) appears rendered as <https://researchobject.github.io/ro-crate/background> (aka  <https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/background> - see `CNAME`). Note that the filename (minus `.md`) is used as the page path, regardless of how the file is nested in the directory structure. You may crosslink pages using relative links like `[background](background)`.

Note that files outside `docs` are not accessible within `github.io` and must be linked to by absolute URLs, e.g. <https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>

It is more important that pages render well at <https://researchobject.github.io/ro-crate/> than in this  preview within the GitHub repository, as some MarkDown features only apply to the GitHub Pages (e.g. the `{:toc}` macro and).

## Running Jekyll locally

To test out your changes locally it may be worth running [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) locally to generate the pages. However installing Jekyll, Ruby and their dependencies locally can be a bit of a challenge depending on your operating system, local permissions and paths.

### Option 1: Run Ruby and Jekyll on your machine

Follow the instructions at [Testing your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll), with these extra notes:

* Ruby 3.0.0 or newer is needed
* The "publishing source" is not the root folder of the repository, but the `docs/` directory, so you should be running your `bundle` commands in the `docs/` directory (the same location as the `Gemfile` which `bundle` reads from)
* The site preview will become available at `http://localhost:4000/ro-crate`

### Option 2: Run the site in a container using Docker or Podman

If you have [Docker] you can avoid the Ruby/Bundler/Jekyll install dance and run from a container:

    make jekyll-docker-serve

Then visit http://0.0.0.0:4000/ro-crate to browse a local rendering. 

Alternatively, to render HTML files into `site/` folder, run:

    make jekyll-docker-oneshot

Equivalent commands for using [Podman](https://podman.io/):

    make jekyll-podman-serve  
    # or
    make jekyll-podman-oneshot

## Using the ELIXIR Toolkit Theme

The theme of this site is based on the [ELIXIR Toolkit theme](https://elixir-belgium.github.io/elixir-toolkit-theme/). All `*.md` files have "front matter" written in YAML which helps the theme to process them, for example:

```
---
title: Metadata of the RO-Crate
excerpt: |
  RO-Crate aims to capture and describe the Research Object using
  structured metadata. The RO-Crate Metadata File Descriptor contains the
  metadata that describes the RO-Crate and its content. This machine-readable
  metadata can also be represented for human consumption in the RO-Crate Website,
  linking to data and Web resources.
redirect_from:
  - /1.1/about
---

<!-- start of page content -->
```

- `excerpt`: This attribute can be used to specify the metadata description of the page
- `redirect_from`: this can be used to list links from which you want to redirect to the page you are editing.

### Navigation

#### Sidebars

Each item in the top navigation bar (defined in [_data/topnav.yml](_data/topnav.yml)) has a corresponding sidebar defined in [_data/sidebars/](_data/sidebars/). These list the links that should appear in each sidebar. 

Each sidebar typically corresponds to one directory under `pages` where the relevant pages are stored, e.g. pages listed in the `about` sidebar are located in `pages/about`. This is configured under `defaults` in [`_config.yml`](_config.yml). There are two notable exceptions:

* the `main` sidebar includes content from `pages/use_cases`, `pages/domains`, `pages/tasks`, AND `pages/roles`.
* the `spec` sidebar is a special case: its content lives in `_specification` and is rendered to URLs prefixed with `specification/version/`, e.g. <https://researchobject.github.io/ro-crate/specification/1.1/terminology>.

If you introduce a new page, place it in an appropriate directory and ensure it is listed in the corresponding sidebar so people can find it.

#### Ordering pages

Ordering pages
To specify page order within a sidebar, you can use the `nav_order` parameter in your pagesâ€™ YAML front matter.

```
---
title: test
nav_order: 4
---
```

The parameter values determine the order of the top-level pages, and of child pages with the same parent. You can reuse the same parameter values (e.g., integers starting from 1) for the child pages of different parents.

#### Excluding pages from navigation and/or search
To hide a page from the main table of content, e.g. a draft, add `nav_exclude: true` to its preamble:

```
---
nav_exclude: true
search_exclude: true
title: Draft section
---
```

For the RO-Crate specification we should only show the **current** specification in the menu, the older and draft versions are indexed from [specification.md](specification.md), therefore `nav_exclude` and `search_exclude` should be set to true on older or draft versions.

Also ensure the page is removed from any sidebar listings.

#### Excluding pages from rendering at all

To avoid a page being rendered to the site at all (i.e. it has no URL outside of the GitHub repository), add it to the `exclude` list in [`_config.yml`](_config.yml)

#### Table of Contents

```
# H1 Title
{: .no_toc }

## Table of contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

1. TOC
{:toc}
```

### Sections and child pages

Note that the [concatination](../Makefile) step to make single page HTML/PDF assumes `<div id="filename">` blobs in top of each section's markdown, as the `Makefile` replaces links to say `"appendix/jsonld.md"` with `#jsonld`. See commit [bfd9b2f530](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/commit/bfd9b2f53075f464b069b017c9648460879dda94)

### Admonition cards

With theme it is possible to insert colourful admonition cards to bring attention to caveats and best practices. 
These are written as a Markdown code-block with the language set as `tip`, `note` or `warning`, and can
include a restricted set of Markdown.

```
{: .tip }
> JSON-LD supports [many other features](https://json-ld.org/) that SHOULD NOT be used excessively.
```

Try to keep the admonition card short, like a single paragraph.

For the [Makefile](Makefile) rendering to PDF, a rudimentary [Pandoc filter](scripts/admonition.py)
attempts to translate these blocks back to paragraph rendering, although they don't show up as a box. 
See the [release procedure](RELEASE_PROCEDURE.md).


### Theme config

The [`_config.yml`](_config.yml) file specifies some site-wide properties like copyright text or which folders that need to be excluded from the navigation and/or search.

## References

The [_includes/references.liquid](_includes/references.liquid) file includes Markdown [hyperlink references](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#reference-links) that can be used on shortform, e.g. `[CreativeWork]` gets expanded to `[CreativeWork](http://schema.org/CreativeWork)`  or `[creative work][CreativeWork]` becomes  `[creative work](http://schema.org/CreativeWork)`. This only works on `*.md` pages that have the `{% include references.liquid %}` footer.
