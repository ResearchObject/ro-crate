# APPENDIX: Handling relative URI references

The _RO-Crate Metadata File_ use _relative URI references_ to identify files and directories
contained within the _RO-Crate Root_ and its children.  As described in section
[Describing entities in JSON-LD](#describing-entities-in-json-ld) above, 
relative URI references are also frequently used for 
identifying _Contextual entities_.

When using JSON-LD tooling and RDF libraries to consume or generate RO-Crates, 
extra care should be taken to ensure these URI references are handled correctly.

For this, a couple of scenarios are sketched below with recommendations for
consistent handling:

## Flattening JSON-LD from nested JSON

If performing
[JSON-LD flattening] to generate a valid _RO-Crate Metadata File_, add `@base: null` to the input JSON-LD `@context` array to avoid expanding relative URI references. The flattening `@context` SHOULD NOT need `@base: null`.

Example, this JSON-LD is in [compacted form][compacted] which may be beneficial for processing, but is not yet valid _RO-Crate Metadata File_ as it has not been flattened into a `@graph` array.

```json
{ 
  "@context": [
    {"@base": null},
    "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT/context"
  ],
  "@id": "ro-crate-metadata.json",
  "@type": "CreativeWork",
  "description": "RO-Crate Metadata File Descriptor (this file)",
  "conformsTo": {"@id": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT"},
  "about": {
    "@id": "./",
    "@type": "Dataset",
    "name": "Example RO-Crate",
    "description": "The RO-Crate Root Data Entity",
    "hasPart": [
      { "@id": "data1.txt",
        "@type": "File",
        "description": "One of hopefully many Data Entities",
      },
      { "@id": "subfolder/",
        "@type": "Dataset"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Performing [JSON-LD flattening] with:

```json
{ "@context": 
     "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT/context"
}
```

Results in a valid _RO-Crate JSON-LD_ (actual order in `@graph` may differ):

```json
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT/context",
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@id": "ro-crate-metadata.json",
      "@type": "CreativeWork",
      "conformsTo": {
        "@id": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT"
      },
      "about": {
        "@id": "./"
      },
      "description": "RO-Crate Metadata File Descriptor (this file)"
    },
    {
      "@id": "./",
      "@type": "Dataset",
      "description": "The RO-Crate Root Data Entity",
      "hasPart": [
        {
          "@id": "data1.txt"
        },
        {
          "@id": "subfolder/"
        }
      ],
      "name": "Example RO-Crate"
    },
    {
      "@id": "data1.txt",
      "@type": "File",
      "description": "One of hopefully many Data Entities"
    },
    {
      "@id": "subfolder/",
      "@type": "Dataset"
    }
  ]
}
```

```note
The saved _RO-Crate JSON-LD_ SHOULD NOT include `{@base: null}` in its `@context`.
```


## Expanding/parsing JSON-LD keeping relative referencing

[JSON-LD Expansion] can be used to 
resolve terms from the `@context` to absolute URIs, e.g. `http://schema.org/description`. This may be needed to parse [extended properties](#extending-ro-crate) or for combinations with other Linked Data.

This algorithm would normally also expand `@id` fields based on the current [base URI][JSON-LD base URI] of the _RO-Crate Metadata File_, but this may be a temporary location like `file:///tmp/rocrate54/ro-crate-metadata.json`, meaning `@id`: `subfolder/` becomes `file:///tmp/rocrate54/subfolder/` after JSON-LD expansion.

To avoid absoluting local identifiers, before expanding, augment the JSON-LD `@context` to ensure it is an array that includes `{"@base": null}`.

For example, expanding this JSON-LD:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT/context",
    {"@base": null}
  ],
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@id": "ro-crate-metadata.json",
      "@type": "CreativeWork",
      "conformsTo": {
        "@id": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT"
      },
      "about": {
        "@id": "./"
      },
      "description": "RO-Crate Metadata File Descriptor (this file)"
    },
    {
      "@id": "./",
      "@type": "Dataset",
      "description": "The RO-Crate Root Data Entity",
      "hasPart": [
        {
          "@id": "data1.txt"
        },
        {
          "@id": "subfolder/"
        }
      ],
      "name": "Example RO-Crate"
    }
  ]
}
```

Results in a [expanded form][JSON-LD expanded form] without `@context`, using absolute URIs for properties and types, but retains relative URI references for entities within the _RO-Crate Root_:

```json
[
  {
    "@id": "ro-crate-metadata.json",
    "@type": [
      "http://schema.org/CreativeWork"
    ],
    "http://schema.org/about": [
      {
        "@id": "./"
      }
    ],
    "http://purl.org/dc/terms/conformsTo": [
      {
        "@id": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT"
      }
    ],
    "http://schema.org/description": [
      {
        "@value": "RO-Crate Metadata File Descriptor (this file)"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "@id": "./",
    "@type": [
      "http://schema.org/Dataset"
    ],
    "http://schema.org/description": [
      {
        "@value": "The RO-Crate Root Data Entity"
      }
    ],
    "http://schema.org/hasPart": [
      {
        "@id": "data1.txt"
      },
      {
        "@id": "subfolder/"
      }
    ],
    "http://schema.org/name": [
      {
        "@value": "Example RO-Crate"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

```note
`@base: null` will not relativize existing absolute URIs that happen to be contained by the _RO-Crate Root_ (see section [Relativizing absolute URIs within RO-Crate Root](#relativizing-absolute-uris-within-ro-crate-root)).
```

```tip
Most RDF parsers supporting JSON-LD will perform this kind of expansion before generating triples, but not all RDF stores or serializations support relative URI references. Consider using an alternative `@base` as detailed in sections below.
```

## Establishing absolute URI for RO-Crate Root

When loading _RO-Crate JSON-LD_ as RDF, or combining the crate's Linked Data into a larger JSON-LD, it is important to ensure correct
[base URI][JSON-LD base URI]
to resolve URI references that are relative to the _RO-Crate Root_.

```note
When retrieving an RO-Crate over the web, servers might have performed HTTP redirections so that the base URI is different from what was requested. It is RECOMMENDED to follow section [Establishing a Base URI of RFC3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-5.1) before resolving relative links from the _RO-Crate Metadata File_.
```

For instance, consider this HTTP redirection from a permalink (simplified):

```http
GET https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.0/crate HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.0/ro-crate-metadata.jsonld
```

```http
GET https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.0/ro-crate-metadata.jsonld HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/ld+json

{
    "@context": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.0/context",
    "@graph": [
      {
        "@id": "ro-crate-metadata.jsonld",
        "@type": "CreativeWork",
        "conformsTo": {
          "@id": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.0"
        },
        "about": {
          "@id": "./"
        },
        "license": {
          "@id": "https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"
        }
      },
      {
        "@id": "./",
        "@type": "Dataset",
        "hasPart": [
          {
            "@id": "index.html"
          }
      }
    ]
}
```

Following redirection we see that:

* _Base URI_ of the _RO-Crate Metadata File_ becomes `https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.0/ro-crate-metadata.jsonld`
* The absolute URI for `index.html` resolves to `https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.0/index.html` 
  - ..rather than `https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.0/index.html` which would not redirect correctly

This example also use RO-Crate 1.0, where the _RO-Crate Metadata File_ is called `ro-crate-metadata.jsonld` instead of `ro-crate-metadata.json`. Note that the recommended
[algorithm to find the Root Data Entity](../root-data-entity.md#finding-the-root-data-entity)
is agnostic to the actual filename.

## Finding RO-Crate Root in RDF triple stores

When parsing _RO-Crate JSON-LD_ as RDF, where the RDF framework performs resolution to absolute URIs, it may be difficult to find the _RO-Crate Root_ in the parsed triples.

The algoritm proposed in section [Root Data Entity](../root-data-entity.md#finding-the-root-data-entity) allows finding the RDF resource describing `ro-crate-metadata.json`, independent of its parsed base URI. We can adopt this for RDF triples, thus finding crates conforming to this specification can be queried with [SPARQL]:

```sparql
PREFIX dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>
PREFIX schema:  <http://schema.org/>

SELECT ?crate ?metadatafile
WHERE {
  ?crate        a                  schema:Dataset .
  ?metadatafile schema:about       ?crate .
  ?metadatafile dcterms:conformsTo <https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT> .
}
```

..or (less efficient) for any RO-Crate version:

```sparql
PREFIX dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>
PREFIX schema:  <http://schema.org/>

SELECT ?crate ?metadatafile ?spec
WHERE {
  ?crate        a                  schema:Dataset .
  ?metadatafile schema:about       ?crate .
  ?metadatafile dcterms:conformsTo ?spec .

  FILTER STRSTARTS(str(?spec), "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/")
}
```


## Parsing as RDF with a different RO-Crate Root

When parsing a _RO-Crate Metadata File_ into [RDF triples], for instance uploading it to a _graph store_ like [Apache Jena]'s [Fuseki], it is important to ensure consistent _base URI_:

* Some RDF stores and RDF formats don't support relative URI references in triples (see [RDF 1.1 note on IRIs])
* The _RO-Crate Root_ may depend on where the _RO-Crate Metadata File_ was parsed from, e.g. `<file:///tmp/ro-crate-metadata.json>` (file) or `<http://localhost:3030/test/ro-crate-metadata.json>` (web upload)
* Parsing multiple RO-Crates into the same RDF graph, using same base URI, may merge them into the same RO-Crate
* `ro-crate-metadata.json` may not be recognized as JSON-LD and must be renamed to `ro-crate-metadata.jsonld`
* Web servers hosting `ro-crate-metadata.json` may not send the [JSON-LD _Content-Type_](#ro-crate-json-ld-media-type)
* If base URI is not correct it may be difficult to find the corresponding file and directory paths from an RDF query returning absolute URIs

```tip
If the RDF library can parse the _RO-Crate JSON-LD_ directly by retrieving from a `http`/`https` URI of the _RO-Crate Metadata File_ it should calculate the correct base URI as detailed in section [Establishing absolute URI for RO-Crate Root](#establishing-absolute-uri-for-ro-crate-root) and you should **not** need to override the base URI as detailed here.
```

If a web-based URI for the _RO-Crate root_ is known, then this can be supplied as a _base URI_. Most RDF tools support a `--base` option or similar. If this is not possible, then the `@context` of the `RO-Crate JSON-LD` can be modified by ensuring the `@context` is an array that sets the desired `@base`:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT/context",
    {"@base": "http://example.com/crate255/"}
  ],
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@id": "ro-crate-metadata.json",
      "@type": "CreativeWork",
      "conformsTo": {
        "@id": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT"
      },
      "about": {
        "@id": "./"
      }
    },
    {
      "@id": "./",
      "@type": "Dataset",
      "name": "Example RO-Crate"
    },
    {
      "@id": "data1.txt",
      "@type": "File",
      "description": "One of hopefully many Data Entities"
    },
    {
      "@id": "subfolder/",
      "@type": "Dataset"
    }
  ]
}
```

Parsing this will generate triples like below using `http://example.com/crate255/` as the _RO-Crate Root_ (shortened):

```turtle
<http://example.com/crate255/ro-crate-metadata.json> 
  <http://purl.org/dc/terms/conformsTo> 
  <https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT> .

<http://example.com/crate255/ro-crate-metadata.json> 
  <http://schema.org/about> 
  <http://example.com/crate255/> .

<http://example.com/crate255/> 
  <http://schema.org/name> 
  "Example RO-Crate" .

<http://example.com/crate255/>
  <http://schema.org/hasPart>
  <http://example.com/crate255/data1.txt> .

<http://example.com/crate255/>
  <http://schema.org/hasPart>
  <http://example.com/crate255/subfolder/> .

<http://example.com/crate255/data1.txt>
 <http://schema.org/description> 
 "One of hopefully many Data Entities" .
```

Generating a _RO-Crate JSON-LD_ from such triples can be done by first [finding the RO-Crate Root](#finding-ro-crate-root-in-rdf-triple-stores) and then use it as base URI to [relativize absolute URIs within RO-Crate Root](#relativizing-absolute-uris-within-ro-crate-root).


## Establishing a base URI inside a ZIP file

An RO-Crate may have been packaged as a ZIP file or similar archive. RO-Crates may exist in a temporary file path which should not determine its identifiers.

When parsing such crates it is recommended to use the
[Archive and Package (arcp) URI scheme][ARCP]
to establish a temporary/location-based UUID or hash-based (SHA256) _base URI_. 

For instance, given a randomly generated UUID `b7749d0b-0e47-5fc4-999d-f154abe68065` we can use `arcp://uuid,b7749d0b-0e47-5fc4-999d-f154abe68065/` as the `@base`:


```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT/context",
    {"@base": "arcp://uuid,b7749d0b-0e47-5fc4-999d-f154abe68065/"}
  ],
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@id": "ro-crate-metadata.json",
      "@type": "CreativeWork",
      "conformsTo": {
        "@id": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT"
      },
      "about": {
        "@id": "./"
      }
    },
    {
      "@id": "./",
      "@type": "Dataset",
      "description": "The RO-Crate Root Data Entity",
      "hasPart": [
        {
          "@id": "data1.txt"
        },
        {
          "@id": "subfolder/"
        }
      ],
      "name": "Example RO-Crate"
    },
    {
      "@id": "data1.txt",
      "@type": "File",
      "description": "One of hopefully many Data Entities"
    },
    {
      "@id": "subfolder/",
      "@type": "Dataset"
    }
  ]
}
```

Parsing this as RDF will generate triples including:

```turtle
<arcp://uuid,b7749d0b-0e47-5fc4-999d-f154abe68065/ro-crate-metadata.json> 
  <http://schema.org/about> 
  <arcp://uuid,b7749d0b-0e47-5fc4-999d-f154abe68065/> .

<arcp://uuid,b7749d0b-0e47-5fc4-999d-f154abe68065/> 
  <http://schema.org/hasPart> 
  <arcp://uuid,b7749d0b-0e47-5fc4-999d-f154abe68065/data1.txt> .
```

Here consumers can assume `/` is the _RO-Crate Root_ and generating relative URIs can safely be achieved by  search-replace as the arcp URI is unique. Saving _RO-Crate JSON-LD_ from the triples can be done by using the arcp URI to [relativize absolute URIs within RO-Crate Root](#relativizing-absolute-uris-within-ro-crate-root).

```tip
**Bagit**: The arcp specification suggests how [BagIt identifiers][ARCP BagIt] can be used to calculate the base URI. See also section [Combining with other packaging schemes](#combining-with-other-packaging-schemes) - note that in this approach the _RO-Crate Root_ will be the payload folder `/data/` under the calculated arcp base URI.
```

## Relativizing absolute URIs within RO-Crate Root

Some applications may prefer working with absolute URIs, e.g. in a joint graph store or web-based repository, but should relativize URIs within the _RO-Crate Root_ before generating the _RO-Crate Metadata File_.

Assuming a repository at `example.com` has JSON-LD with absolute URIs:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT",
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@id": "http://example.com/crate415/ro-crate-metadata.json",
      "@type": "CreativeWork",
      "conformsTo": {
        "@id": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT"
      },
      "about": {
        "@id": "http://example.com/crate415/"
      },
    },
    {
      "@id": "http://example.com/crate415/",
      "@type": "Dataset",
      "description": "The RO-Crate Root Data Entity",
      "hasPart": [
        {
          "@id": "http://example.com/crate415/data1.txt"
        },
        {
          "@id": "http://example.com/crate415/subfolder/"
        }
      ],
      "name": "Example RO-Crate"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then performing [JSON-LD flattening] with this `@context`:

```json
{ "@context": [
    {"@base": "http://example.com/crate415/"},
     "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT"
  ]
}
```

Will output _RO-Crate JSON-LD_ with relative URIs:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    {
      "@base": "http://example.com/crate415/"
    },
    "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT"
  ],
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@id": "./",
      "@type": "Dataset",
      "description": "The RO-Crate Root Data Entity",
      "hasPart": [
        {
          "@id": "data1.txt"
        },
        {
          "@id": "subfolder/"
        }
      ],
      "name": "Example RO-Crate"
    },
    {
      "@id": "ro-crate-metadata.json",
      "@type": "CreativeWork",
      "conformsTo": {
        "@id": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT"
      },
      "about": {
        "@id": "./"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

```warning
This method would also relativize URIs outside the _RO-Crate Root_ that are on the same host, e.g. `http://example.com/crate255/other.txt` would become `../create255/other.txt` - this can particularly be a challenge with local `file:///` URIs.
