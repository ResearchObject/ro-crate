# Dataverse & AROMA

AROMA (ARP RO-Crate Manager) is part of Hungarian initiative [ELKH ARP](https://science-research-data.hu/en), extending [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/) to allow dynamic metadata editing of data deposit metadata using multiple schemas, mapped using  and presented using the [Describo Crate Builder Web](https://github.com/describo/crate-builder-component-react) component. Different [Metadata blocks](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/admin/metadatacustomization.html) in Dataverse are supported.

Work on [Dataverse support for RO-Crate](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/8688) continues in collaboration with FAIR-IMPACT collaborators. The [ELN archive])https://github.com/gdcc/dataverse-previewers/pull/21()
