# RO-Crate in use
{: .no_toc }

These applications use or expose RO-Crates to describe Data, Datasets and Workflows:

1. TOC
{:toc}


## WorkflowHub

[WorkflowHub](https://about.workflowhub.eu/) imports and exports [Workflow RO-Crates](https://about.workflowhub.eu/Workflow-RO-Crate/), using it as an exchange format. They are a specialization of RO-Crate for packaging an executable workflow with all necessary documentation. It is aligned with, and intends to strictly extend, the more general [Bioschemas ComputationalWorkflow profile](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/ComputationalWorkflow/1.0-RELEASE/).


## LifeMonitor

[LifeMonitor](life_monitor) uses RO-Crate as an exchange format for describing test suites associated with workflows. To this end, the LifeMonitor team is developing an extension to the [Workflow RO-Crate specification](https://about.workflowhub.eu/Workflow-RO-Crate/) to support the inclusion of metadata related to the testing of computational workflows stored in the crate.

## Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA)

[LDaCA](LDaCA) uses RO-Crate as an interchange and archive format for language data, and is providing data discovery portals and API access to data using RO-Crate-centric APIs.]

## Arkisto

[Arkisto uses RO-Crate](https://arkisto-platform.github.io/standards/ro-crate/) for packaging data objects in the 3 uses cases described below, **Modern PARADISEC**, **UTS Research Data Repository** and **UTS Cultural Datasets**.

As part of these use-cases they have been developing or enhancing their tooling to facilitate their use of RO-Crate

  * [OCFL-indexer](https://github.com/CoEDL/modpdsc/) is a NodeJS application that walks the [Oxford Common File Layout](https://ocfl.io/) on the file system, validate _RO-Crate Metadata Files_ and parse into objects registered in Elasticsearch. (~ _alpha_) 
  * [ocfl-tools](https://github.com/CoEDL/ocfl-tools) contains tools for managing RO-Crates in an OCFL repository .
  * [ocfl-viewer](https://hub.docker.com/r/coedl/ocfl-viewer)
  * [ONI indexer](https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/oni-indexer)

### Modern PARADISEC

[Modern PARADISEC](https://arkisto-platform.github.io/case-studies/paradisec/) demonstrates the use of RO-Crate to describe the collections and items. The demonstrator includes an elastic search service and a webserver but the key feature is that it keeps working with only the filesystem and a webserver.

### UTS Research Data Repository

The [UTS Data Repository](https://arkisto-platform.github.io/case-studies/uts-repo/) UTS Research Data Repository is a searchable portal for discovering and accessing public datasets by UTS researchers. Datasets are described with RO-Crates and published either through the Universityâ€™s institutional research data management system or direct import from research storage devices for very large datasets.

### UTS Cultural Datasets

The [UTS Cultural Datasets](https://arkisto-platform.github.io/case-studies/uts-cultural/) project is collaborating with Humanities and Social Science (HASS) researchers and is re-using existing UTS Data infrastructure to build interactive services that allow people to use the data. They make use of RO-Crate to be able to directly transfer data and mappings to the [Expert Nation database](https://expertnation.org/).

## Workflow Execution Service (WfExS)

[WfExS-backend](https://github.com/inab/WfExS-backend) is a high-level workflow execution command line program that consumes and creates RO-Crates, focusing on
the interconnection of content-sensitive research infrastructures for handling sensitive human data analysis scenarios.
WfExS-backend delegates workflow execution of existing workflow engines, and it is designed to facilitate more secure
and reproducible workflow executions to promote analysis reproducibility and replicability. Secure executions are
achieved using FUSE encrypted directories for non-disclosable inputs, intermediate workflow execution results and output
files.

RO-Crates are, indeed, an element of knowledge transfer between repeated workflow executions. WfExS-backend stores all
the gathered details, output metadata and execution provenance in the output RO-Crate to achieve future reproducible
executions. Final execution results can be encrypted with crypt4gh GA4GH standard using the public keys of the target
researchers or destination, so the results can be safely moved outside the execution environments through unsecured
networks and storages.

## ROHub

[ROHub](rohub.md) is a solution for the storage, lifecycle management and preservation of scientific work and operational processes via research objects. It makes these resources available to others, allows to publish and release them through a DOI, and allows to discover and reuse pre-existing scientific knowledge.

ROHub imports and exports RO-Crates, using it as an exchange format, particularly for Earth Science _data cubes_ following the [RELIANCE RO-Crate profile](https://reliance-eosc.github.io/reliance-ro-crate/).

## Research Object Composer

[Research Object Composer](https://github.com/researchobject/research-object-composer) is a REST API for gradually building and depositing Research Objects according to a pre-defined profile. It uses JSON as an intermediate format and modified JSON schemas to define a Profile (RO-Crate support _alpha_)

## Machine-actionable data management plans

[RDA maDMP Mapper](https://github.com/GhaithArf/ro-crate-rda-madmp-mapper) and [Ro-Crate_2_ma-DMP](https://github.com/BrennerG/Ro-Crate_2_ma-DMP/tree/r2d_) can convert between machine-actionable data management plans (maDMP) and RO-Crate. See <https://doi.org/10.4126/frl01-006423291> for details.

## DataPlant

[DataPlant](https://nfdi4plants.org/) is implementing [Annotated Research Context (ARC)](https://nfdi4plants.org/content/learn-more/annotated-research-context.html), an RO-Crate profile that combines the Investigation Study Assay model ([ISA](https://isa-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/isamodel.html)) and the Common Workflow Language ([CWL](https://www.commonwl.org/)) to capture a range from single experimental setups to complex experimental designs. 

In ARC, files are managed in a git repository with a fixed structure following the ISA model, in addition to metadata in an Excel spreadsheet. The [arcCommander](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/arcCommander) tool can help with managing this structure, while the tool [arc--to-roc](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/arc-to-roc) can inspect the structure to generate an RO-Crate metadata file.
The [ARC specification](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARC-specification/blob/main/ARC%20specification.md#appendix-conversion-of-arcs-to-ro-crates) allows augmentation by adding an explicit `ro-crate-metadata.json` to the ARC.

## FAIRSCAPE

[FAIRSCAPE](https://fairscape.github.io/) is a framework for reusable cloud-based computations using [ARK identifiers](https://arks.org/) with rich provenance in an [evidence graph](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-80960-7_3) and the [Evidence Graph Ontology](https://w3id.org/EVI) (EVI). The command line [fairscape-cli](https://fairscape.github.io/fairscape-cli/) uses RO-Crate and BagIt for data validation and packaging in FAIRSCAPE. This approach is used for [Cell Maps for AI (CM4AI)](https://cm4ai.org/), a part of NIH's [Bridge2AI](https://commonfund.nih.gov/bridge2ai) program.

* Publication: <https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-80960-7_3>

## Data Stewardship Wizard

The [Data Stewardship Wizard](https://ds-wizard.org/) (DSW) is an interactive platform for making data management plans. By using the [ro-crate-template](https://github.com/ds-wizard/ro-crate-template) it is possible to export RO-Crate from DSW.

## Sciebo RDS

Sciebo RDS (Research Data Services) is a self-hosted interface between data repositories and file storage solutions, assisting the research data deposition process with annotations made using [Describo Online](https://arkisto-platform.github.io/tools/description/describo-online/) and stored as an RO-Crate, which is then mapped to the chosen repository's metadata scheme. Supported repositories include OSF, InvenioRDM, Harvard Dataverse. This is developed as a [CS3MESH4EOSC](https://cs3mesh4eosc.eu/) with cultural heritage studies archive PARADISEC as use case.

## AROMA

AROMA (ARP RO-Crate Manager) is part of Hungarian initiative [ELKH ARP](https://science-research-data.hu/en), extending [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/) to allow dynamic metadata editing of data deposit metadata using multiple schemas, mapped using  and presented using the [Describo Crate Builder Web](https://github.com/describo/crate-builder-component-react) component. Different [Metadata blocks](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/admin/metadatacustomization.html) in Dataverse are supported.

Work on [Dataverse support for RO-Crate](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/8688) continues in collaboration with FAIR-IMPACT collaborators. The [ELN archive](https://github.com/gdcc/dataverse-previewers/pull/21)
