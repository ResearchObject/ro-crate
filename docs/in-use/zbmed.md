# ZBMed

The [Semantic Technologies](https://zbmed-semtec.github.io/) (SemTec) team in [ZB MED](https://www.zbmed.de/en/) uses GitHub pages to share research projects and corresponding research artefacts/outcomes.

Using [FAIR Signposting](https://signposting.org/FAIR/), Bioschemas and RO-Crate this is an example of a lightweight deployment of FAIR Digital Objects (FDOs). 

This work was supported by a [FAIR-IMPACT support action](https://fair-impact.eu/1st-open-call-support-closed) and developed further at the ELIXIR Biohackathon 2023.
