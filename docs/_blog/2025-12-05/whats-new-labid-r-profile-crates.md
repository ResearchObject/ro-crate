## Use case updates

A new use case has been added to the RO-Crate website:
* [Lab Integrated Data (LabID)]({{baseurl}}{% link pages/use_cases/labid.md %}) (written by Laurent Thomas) is a FAIR data management platform that can import and export workflows and workflow runs as RO-Crates

The [nf-prov]({{baseurl}}{% link pages/use_cases/nf-prov.md %}) use case was also updated.

## Tool updates

Two new RO-Crate tools have been published:
* [`rocrateR`](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate-r) (developed by Roberto Villegas-Diaz) - an R package for creating, manipulating and reading RO-Crates, available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rocrateR) 
* [`RO-Crate Profile Crate Creator`](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ROCratePCC) (developed by Lukas Weil and Eli Chadwick) - a helper package for creating RO-Crate [Profile Crates](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.2/profiles.html#profile-crate), a type of RO-Crate that represents an RO-Crate profile. The package is available in [.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ROCratePCC/), [Python](https://pypi.org/project/rocratepcc/), and [JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nfdi4plants/rocratepcc).
