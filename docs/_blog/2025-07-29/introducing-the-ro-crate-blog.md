This is the first post in a new section on the RO-Crate website: a [blog]({% link pages/community/blog.md %}). Here we will post news and announcements relevant to the RO-Crate community, as well as occasional developer blogs and articles written by members of the community. 

You can find the blog section by clicking "Blog" in the navigation bar.

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute a post to the blog, or you have news you want to share with the community, please [contact us]({{baseurl}}{% link pages/community/community.md %}#contact-us)!

You could write about:
* how you're using RO-Crate in your project or domain
* an event you attended where RO-Crate was mentioned
