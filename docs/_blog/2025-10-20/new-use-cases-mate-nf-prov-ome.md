Three new use cases have been added to the RO-Crate website:
* [M@TE (Model Atlas of the Earth)]({{baseurl}}{% link pages/use_cases/mate.md %}) (written by Sara Polanco) packages geoscience models using RO-Crate
* [Open Microscopy Environment]({{baseurl}}{% link pages/use_cases/ome.md %}) (written by Tiago Lubiana) applies RO-Crate to bioimaging
* [nf-prov Nextflow plugin]({{baseurl}}{% link pages/use_cases/nf-prov.md %}) (written by Simone Leo) allows Workflow Run RO-Crates to be exported from Nextflow workflows.
