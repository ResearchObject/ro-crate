**News**: [RO-Crate Metadata specification 1.1](https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1) released

## What is RO-Crate? 
RO-Crate is a community effort to establish a lightweight approach to packaging research data with their metadata. It is based on schema.org annotations in JSON-LD, and aims to make best-practice in formal metadata description accessible and practical for use in a wider variety of situations, from an individual researcher working with a folder of data, to large data-intensive computational research environments. 

## Where did RO-Crate come from?
RO-Crate is the marriage of [Research Objects](https://www.researchobject.org/) with [DataCrate](https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/datacrate). It aims to build on their respective strengths, but also to draw on lessons learned from those projects and similar research data packaging efforts. For more details, see [background](background.md).

## Who is it for?
The RO-Crate effort brings together practitioners from very different backgrounds, and with different motivations and use-cases. Among our core target users are: a) researchers engaged with computation and data-intensive, workflow-driven analysis; b) digital repository managers and infrastructure providers; c) individual researchers looking for a straight-forward tool or how-to guide to "FAIRify" their data; d) data stewards supporting research projects in creating and curating datasets.

We continue to [gather usecases](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ause-case), please help us by [adding more](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues/new/choose).
  
## How can I get started?

Follow the [RO-Crate tutorials](tutorials) for training material that introduce RO-Crate. 

Alternatively, see the [walk-through of an RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.2-DRAFT/introduction.html) to learn by example.

RO-Crate is defined as an specification with recommendations and many inline [examples](examples.html):

* [RO-Crate specification 1.1](1.1/) has been **released**.

See the [specification](specification.md) page for older and future versions.


## What can I use RO-Crate with?

We maintain a list of RO-Crate [tools](tools/) and [examples](examples).


## RO-Crate in use

We describe some current cases and applications of where [RO-Crate is in use](in-use) for packaging and describing data, datasets and workflows.

## Contribute to RO-Crate community

RO-Crate is developed as a [community effort](community.md) and an Open Source project.

You are welcome to [join us](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues/1)!  Contributors are expected to comply with our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure an open and inclusive environment.

The RO-Crate team try to meet in a monthly telcon, see the [rolling agenda](https://s.apache.org/ro-crate-minutes) for schedule, call-in details and minutes.
