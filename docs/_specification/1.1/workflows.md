1. TOC
{:toc}

Scientific workflows and scripts that were used (or can be used) to analyze or generate files contained in an RO-Crate MAY be embedded in an RO-Crate. See also the Provenance section on [Software Used to Create Files](provenance#software-used-to-create-files).

_Workflows_ and _scripts_ SHOULD be described using [data entities](data-entities) of type [SoftwareSourceCode].

The distinction between [SoftwareSourceCode] and [SoftwareApplication] for [software](provenance#software-used-to-create-files) is fluid, and comes down to availability and understandability. For instance, office spreadsheet applications are generally available and do not need further explanation (`SoftwareApplication`); while a Python script that is customized for a particular data analysis might be important to understand deeper and should therefore be included as `SoftwareSourceCode` in the RO-Crate dataset.

## Describing scripts and workflows

A script is a _Data Entity_ which MUST have the following properties:

* `@type` is an array with at least `File` and `SoftwareSourceCode` as values
* `@id` is a File URI linking to the executable script
* `name`: a human-readable [name] for the script.

A workflow is a _Data Entity_ which MUST have the following properties:

* `@type` is an array with at least `File`, `SoftwareSourceCode` and `ComputationalWorkflow` as values
* `@id` is a File URI linking to the workflow entry-point.
* `name`: a human-readable [name] for the workflow.

Short example describing a _script_:

```json
{
  "@id": "scripts/analyse_csv.py",
  "@type": ["File", "SoftwareSourceCode"],
  "name": "Analyze CSV files",
  "programmingLanguage": {"@id": "https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/"}
}
```

Short example describing a _workflow_:

```json
{
    "@id": "workflow/retropath.knime",  
    "@type": ["File", "SoftwareSourceCode", "ComputationalWorkflow"],
    "author": {"@id": "#thomas"},
    "name": "RetroPath Knime workflow",
    "description": "Retrosynthesis workflow calculating chemical reactions",
    "license": { "@id": "https://spdx.org/licenses/CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0"},
    "programmingLanguage": {"@id": "#knime"}
}
```

There is no strong distinction between a _script_ and a _workflow_; many computational workflows are written in script-like languages, and many scripts perform a _pipeline_ of steps.

Here are some indicators for when a script should be considered a _workflow_:

* It performs a series of steps (_pipeline_)
* The executed steps are mainly external tools or services
* The main work is performed by the steps (script is not algorithmic)
* The steps exchange data in a _dataflow_, typically file inputs/outputs
* The script has well-defined _inputs_ and _outputs_, e.g. file arguments

Here are some counter-indicators for when a script might **not** be a workflow:

* The script contains mainly algorithms or logic
* Data is exchanged out of bands, e.g. a SQL database
* The script relies on a particular state of the system (e.g. appends existing files)
* An interactive user interface that controls the actions

## Workflow Runtime and Programming Language

Scripts written in a _programming language_, as well as workflows, generally need a _runtime_; in RO-Crate the runtime SHOULD be indicated using a liberal interpretation of [programmingLanguage].

Note that the language and its runtime MAY differ (e.g. different C++ compilers), but for scripts and workflows, frequently the language and runtime are essentially the same, and thus the `programmingLanguage`, implied to be a [ComputerLanguage], can also be described as an executable [SoftwareApplication]:

```json
{
  "@id": "scripts/analyse_csv.py",
  "@type": ["File", "SoftwareSourceCode"],
  "name": "Analyze CSV files",
  "programmingLanguage": {"@id": "https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/"}
},
{
  "@id": "https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/",
  "@type": ["ComputerLanguage", "SoftwareApplication"],
  "name": "Python 3.8.0",
  "version": "3.8.0"
}
```

A _contextual entity_ representing a [ComputerLanguage] and/or [SoftwareApplication] MUST have a [name], [url] and [version], which should indicate a known version the workflow/script was developed or tested with. [alternateName] MAY be provided if there is a shorter colloquial name, for instance _“R”_ instead of _“The R Project for Statistical Computing”_.

It is possible to indicate _steps_ that are executed as part of an `ComputationalWorkflow` or `Script`, by using [hasPart] to relate additional `SoftwareApplication` or nested `SoftwareSourceCode` contextual entities:

```json
{
    "@id": "workflow/analyze.cwl",  
    "@type": ["File", "SoftwareSourceCode", "ComputationalWorkflow"],
    "name": "CWL workflow to analyze CSV and make PNG",
    "programmingLanguage": {"@id": "https://w3id.org/cwl/v1.1/"},
    "hasPart": [
      {"@id": "scripts/analyse_csv.py"},
      {"@id": "https://www.imagemagick.org/"}
    ]
}
```


## Workflow diagram/sketch

It can be beneficial to show a diagram or sketch to explain the script/workflow. This may have been generated from a workflow management system, or drawn manually as a diagram. This diagram MAY be included from the `SoftwareSourceCode` data entity by using `image`, pointing to an [ImageObject] data entity which is [about] the `SoftwareSourceCode`:

```json
{
  "@id": "workflow/workflow.knime",  
  "@type": ["File", "SoftwareSourceCode", "ComputationalWorkflow"],
  "name": "RetroPath2.0 workflow",
  "image": {"@id": "workflow/workflow.svg" } 
},
{
  "@id": "workflow/workflow.svg",
  "@type": ["File", "ImageObject"],
  "encodingFormat":  "image/svg+xml",
  "name": "Diagram of RetroPath2.0 workflow",
  "about": {"@id": "workflow/workflow.knime"}
}
```

The image file format SHOULD be indicated with [encodingFormat] using an IANA registered [media type] like `image/svg+xml` or `image/png`. Additionally a reference to a [Pronom] identifier SHOULD be provided, which MAY be described as an additional contextual entity to give human-readable name to the format:

```json
{
  "@id": "workflow/workflow.svg",
  "@type": ["File", "ImageObject"],
  "encodingFormat":  ["image/svg+xml"],
  "name": "Diagram of RetroPath2.0 workflow",
  "about": {"@id": "workflow/workflow.knime"}
},

```

A workflow diagram may still be provided even if there is no programmatic `SoftwareSourceCode` that can be executed (e.g. because the workflow was done by hand). In this case the sketch itself is a proxy for the workflow and SHOULD have an `about` property referring to the _RO-Crate dataset_ as a whole (assuming the RO-Crate represents the outcome of a single workflow), or to other [Data Entities](data-entities) otherwise:

```json
{
  "@id": "workflow/workflow.svg",
  "@type": ["File", "ImageObject"],
  "encodingFormat":  ["image/svg+xml"],
  "name": "Diagram of an ad hoc workflow",
  "about": {"@id": "./"}
}
```

## Complying with Bioschemas Computational Workflow profile

Data entities representing _workflows_ (`@type: ComputationalWorkflow`)
SHOULD comply with the Bioschemas [ComputationalWorkflow profile][ComputationalWorkflow profile 0.5],
where possible. 

When complying with this profile, the workflow data entities
MUST describe these properties and their related contextual entities:
[name], [programmingLanguage], [creator], [dateCreated], [license], [sdPublisher], [url], [version].

The [ComputationalWorkflow profile][ComputationalWorkflow profile 0.5] explains the above and list additional properties that a compliant [ComputationalWorkflow][ComputationalWorkflow 0.1] data entity SHOULD include: [citation], [contributor], [creativeWorkStatus], [description], [funding], [hasPart], [isBasedOn], [keywords], [maintainer], [producer], [publisher], [runtimePlatform], [softwareRequirements], [targetProduct]

A data entity conforming to the [ComputationalWorkflow profile][ComputationalWorkflow profile 0.5] SHOULD declare the versioned profile URI using [conformsTo]:

```json
{ "@id": "workflow/alignment.knime",  
  "@type": ["File", "SoftwareSourceCode", "ComputationalWorkflow"],
  "conformsTo": 
    {"@id": "https://bioschemas.org/profiles/ComputationalWorkflow/0.5-DRAFT-2020_07_21/"},
  "..": ""
}
```

### Describing inputs and outputs

The input and output _parameters_ for a workflow or script can be given with `input` and `output` to [FormalParameter][FormalParameter 0.1]
contextual entities. Note that this entity usually represent a _potential_ input/output value in a reusable
workflow, much like [function parameter definitions] in general programming.

If complying with the Bioschemas [FormalParameter profile][FormalParameter profile 0.1],
the _contextual entities_ for [FormalParameter][FormalParameter 0.1], referenced by `input` or `output`, MUST describe: [name], [additionalType], [encodingFormat]

The Bioschemas [FormalParameter profile][FormalParameter profile 0.1] explains the above and lists additional properties that can be used, including [description], [valueRequired], [defaultValue] and [identifier].

A contextual entity conforming to the [FormalParameter profile][FormalParameter profile 0.1] SHOULD declare the versioned profile URI using [conformsTo], e.g.:

```json
{
  "@id": "#36aadbd4-4a2d-4e33-83b4-0cbf6a6a8c5b",
  "@type": "FormalParameter",
  "conformsTo": 
    {"@id": "https://bioschemas.org/profiles/FormalParameter/0.1-DRAFT-2020_07_21/"},
  "..": ""
}
```

{: .note }
> `input`, `output` and `FormalParameter` are at time of writing proposed by Bioschemas and not yet integrated in Schema.org
