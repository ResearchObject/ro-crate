# The focus of an RO-Crate {#crate-focus}

In addition to simple data packaging, RO-Crates may have a "main" entry point or topic (referenced with a singleton `mainEntity` property), or function as a bundle of one or more Contextual Entities referenced via the `mentions` property.

## RO-Crates with a "main entity"

An RO-Crate may have a single main entity that is considered the point, or focus of the RO-Crate. This may be referenced from the _Root Data Entity_ using the [mainEntity] property.

### RO-Crates with a data entity as `mainEntity`

The focus of an RO-Crate may be a single _Data Entity_ supplemented by other data and/or contextual entities.

For example, in the [Workflow RO-Crate profile](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/profiles.html#workflow-ro-crate-profile), the use of `mainEntity` singles-out the workflow file from supporting files.

```json
{
    "@id": "./",
    "@type": "Dataset",
    "name": "Example Workflow",
    "description": "An example workflow RO Crate",
    "license": "Apache-2.0",
    "datePublished": "2023-01-01",
    "mainEntity": {
      "@id": "example_workflow.cwl"
    },
    "hasPart": [
      {
        "@id": "example_workflow.cwl"
      },
      {
        "@id": "diagram.svg"
      },
      {
        "@id": "README.md"
      }
    ]
}
```

### RO-Crates with a contextual entity as `mainEntity`

The focus of the RO-Crate may be a description of a _Contextual Entity_, for example in an RO-Crate used in a repository or encyclopedia where a `RepositoryObject` bundles together images and other files, but the main focus of the RO-Crate is on describing a person.

```json
{
    "@id": "./",
    "@type": ["Dataset", "RepositoryObject"],
    "name": "Reibey, Mary (1777 - 1855)",
    "...": "...",
    "mainEntity": {
        "@id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Reibey"
    },
    "hasPart" : [
        {"@id": "photo1.jpg"},
        {"@id": "photo2.jpg"}
    ]
}

{
    "@id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Reibey",
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Mary Reibey",
    "description": "Mary Reibey née Haydock (12 May 1777 – 30 May 1855) was an English-born merchant, shipowner and trader ..."
}
```

## RO-Crates which focus on multiple _Contextual Entities_

RO-Crates may describe _Contextual Entities_ which are linked to the [Root Data Entity](root-data-entity) via `mentions` relationships.

For example, RO-Crates can be used as containers for Schema.org-style vocabularies (here also [extending the RO-Crate JSON-LD context](appendix/jsonld.html#ro-crate-json-ld-context) to define the namespace for `txc:`):

```json
{ "@context": [
    "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT/context",
    {"txc": "https://purl.archive.org/language-data-commons/terms#"}
  ],
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@id": "ro-crate-metadata.json",
      "@type": "CreativeWork",
      "description": "RO-Crate Metadata File Descriptor (this file)",
      "conformsTo": {"@id": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT"},
      "about": {"@id": "./"}
    },
    {
      "@id": "./",
      "@type": "Dataset",
      "description": "This is an experimental language data ontology based on OLAC terms for use in the ATAP and LDaCA projects",
      "hasPart": [],
      "name": "Language Data Ontology",
      "mentions": ["txc:Annotation", "txc:CollectionEvent"]
    },
    {
      "@id": "txc:Annotation",
      "@type": "rdfs:Class",
      "name": "Annotation",
      "sameAs": "http://www.language-archives.org/REC/type-20020628.html#annotation",
      "rdfs:comment": "The resource includes information which annotates some other linguistic record.",
      "rdfs:label": "Annotation",
      "rdfs:subClassOf": {
        "@id": "schema:CreativeWork"
      }
    },
    {
      "@id": "txc:CollectionEvent",
      "@type": "rdfs:Class",
      "name": "CollectionEvent",
      "rdfs:comment": "A description of an event at which one or more PrimaryTexts were captured, e.g. as video or audio",
      "rdfs:label": "CollectionEvent",
      "rdfs:subClassOf": [
        {
          "@id": "schema:Event"
        },
        {
          "@id": "schema:CreateAction"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}    
```


The following example shows how both `mainEntity` and `mentions` can be used together, in this case to describe a workflow with a test suite:
  * the `mainEntity` is the workflow file, a _Data Entity_
  * the test suite `#test1` is a _Contextual Entity_ highlighted using `mentions`.

```json
{
    "@id": "./",
    "@type": "Dataset",
    "name": "sort-and-change-case",
    "description": "sort lines and change text to upper case",
    "license": "Apache-2.0",
    "mainEntity": {
        "@id": "sort-and-change-case.ga"
    },
    "mentions": [ {"@id": "#test1"} ],
    "hasPart": [
        {
            "@id": "sort-and-change-case.ga"
        },
        {
            "@id": "test/test1/sort-and-change-case-test.yml"
        }
    ]
},
{
    "@id": "#test1",
    "name": "test1",
    "@type": "TestSuite",
    "instance": [
        {"@id": "#test1_1"}
    ],
    "definition": {"@id": "test/test1/sort-and-change-case-test.yml"}
},
{
    "@id": "#test1_1",
    "name": "test1_1",
    "@type": "TestInstance",
    "runsOn": {"@id": "#jenkins"},
    "url": "http://example.org/jenkins",
    "resource": "job/tests/"
},
{
    "@id": "test/test1/sort-and-change-case-test.yml",
    "@type": [
        "File",
        "TestDefinition"
    ],
    "conformsTo": {"@id": "#planemo"}
},
{
    "@id": "#jenkins",
    "@type": "TestService",
    "name": "Jenkins",
    "url": {"@id": "https://www.jenkins.io"}
