# Root Data Entity

1. TOC
{:toc}

The **Root Data Entity** is a [Dataset] that represent the RO-Crate as a whole;
a _Research Object_ that includes the _Data Entities_ and the related
_Contextual Entities_.

An RO-Crate is described using _JSON-LD_ by an _RO-Crate Metadata Document_. As explained in section [RO-Crate structure](structure) this may be stored in an _RO-Crate Metadata File_. In this section we describe the format of the JSON-LD document.


## RO-Crate Metadata Descriptor

The _RO-Crate Metadata Document_ MUST contain a self-describing
**RO-Crate Metadata Descriptor** with
the `@id` value `ro-crate-metadata.json` (or `ro-crate-metadata.jsonld` in legacy
crates) and `@type` [CreativeWork]. This descriptor MUST have an [about]
property referencing the _Root Data Entity_'s `@id`.

```json

{ "@context": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT/context", 
  "@graph": [
    {
        "@type": "CreativeWork",
        "@id": "ro-crate-metadata.json",
        "about": {"@id": "./"},
        "conformsTo": {"@id": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT"}
    },
    
    {
      "@id": "./",
      "@type": "Dataset",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

{: .note}
> Even in [Detached RO-Crates](structure#detached-ro-crate-packages) which do not have an _RO-Crate Metadata File_ present, the identifier `ro-crate-metadata.json` MUST be used.

The [conformsTo] of the _RO-Crate Metadata Descriptor_ 
SHOULD be a versioned permalink URI of the RO-Crate specification
that the _RO-Crate JSON-LD_ conforms to. The URI SHOULD 
start with `https://w3id.org/ro/crate/`. 

{: .tip }
> The `conformsTo` property MAY be an array, to additionally indicate 
specializing [RO-Crate profiles](profiles).

If the root data entity `@id` is an absolute URI, the RO-Crate is considered
web-based: in this case, the metadata descriptor SHOULD also have an absolute
URI as its `@id`, which MUST have `ro-crate-metadata.json` (or
`ro-crate-metadata.jsonld` in legacy crates) as its last path segment.

### Finding the Root Data Entity

In most cases, consumers processing the RO-Crate as a JSON-LD graph can thus
reliably find the _Root Data Entity_ by following this algorithm:

1. For each entity in `@graph` array
2. .. if the `@id` is `ro-crate-metadata.json`
3. .... from this entity's `about` object, keep the `@id` URI as variable _root_
4. For each entity in `@graph` array
5. .. if the entity has an `@id` URI that matches _root_ return it

Note that the above can be implemented efficiently by first building a map (`entity_map`) of
all entities using their `@id` as keys (which is typically also helpful for
further processing) and then performing a series of lookups:

```javascript
metadata_entity = entity_map["ro-crate-metadata.json"]
root_entity = entity_map[metadata_entity["about"]["@id"]]
```

<!-- 

EDITORS NOTE (PTSEFTON) THIS SHOULD BE REMOVED PENDING IMPLEMENTATION (I think we agreed this at the final meeting for 2024) -- can be considered for RO-Crate 2. 


More generally, the metadata id can be a URI whose last path segment is
`ro-crate-metadata.json`, so the above lookup can fail. In this case we can
find the root entity by executing an algorithm similar to the one shown above,
with the only difference that step 2 must be replaced by:

2. .. if the `@id`'s last path segment is `ro-crate-metadata.json`

It is possible to build an RO-Crate having more than one entity whose `@id`
has `ro-crate-metadata.json` as its last path segment. For instance, the crate
could reference a collection of sample _RO-Crate metadata file_s available from
different web sites, or from the same web site but at different locations. In
order to facilitate consumption, data entities representing such files SHOULD
NOT have an `about` property pointing to a [Dataset] in the crate, so they can
be told apart from the actual Metadata Descriptor. A scenario that can
potentially lead to confusion is when a dataset in the crate is itself an
RO-Crate (_nested_ RO-Crate): again, the crate could be a collection of
RO-Crate examples. In this case, the top-level crate SHOULD NOT list any files
or directories belonging to the nested crates, but only the nested crates
themselves as [Dataset] entries. For instance:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT/context",
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@id": "http://example.org/crate/ro-crate-metadata.json",
      "@type": "CreativeWork",
      "about": {"@id": "http://example.org/crate/"},
      "conformsTo": {"@id": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2-DRAFT"}
    },
    {
      "@id": "http://example.org/crate/",
      "@type": "Dataset",
      "hasPart": [
        {"@id": "http://example.org/crate/nested/"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "@id": "http://example.org/crate/nested/",
      "@type": "Dataset"
    }
  ]
}
```
-->

[finding RO-Crate Root in RDF triple stores](appendix/relative-uris#finding-ro-crate-root-in-rdf-triple-stores).

### Purpose of Metadata Document

To ensure a base-line interoperability between RO-Crates, and for an RO-Crate to
be considered a _Valid RO-Crate_, a minimum set of metadata is required for the
_Root Data Entity_. As [stated earlier](structure#self-describing-and-self-contained-local-ro-crate-packages)
the _RO-Crate Metadata Document_ is not an
exhaustive manifest or inventory, that is, it does not necessarily list or
describe all files in the package. For this reason, there are no minimum
metadata requirements in terms of describing [Data Entities](data-entities) (files and folders)
other than the _Root Data Entity_. Extensions of RO-Crate dealing with specific
types of dataset may put further constraints or requirements of metadata beyond
the Root Data Entity (see the appendix [Extending RO-Crate](appendix/jsonld#extending-ro-crate)).

The _RO-Crate Metadata Descriptor_ MAY contain information such as
licensing for the _RO-Crate Metadata Document_ if metadata is licensed
separately from the crate's Data entities.

The section below outlines the properties that the _Root Data Entity_ MUST have to
be minimally valid.

## Direct properties of the Root Data Entity

The _Root Data Entity_ MUST have the following properties:

*  `@type`: MUST be [Dataset] or an array that contain `Dataset`
*  `@id`:  SHOULD be the string `./` or an absolute URI (see [below](#root-data-entity-identifier))
*  `name`: SHOULD identify the dataset to humans well enough to disambiguate it from other RO-Crates
*  `description`: SHOULD further elaborate on the name to provide a summary of the context in which the dataset is important.
*  `datePublished`: MUST be a single string value in [ISO 8601 date format][DateTime] and SHOULD be specified to at least the precision of a day, MAY be a timestamp down to the millisecond. 
*  `license`: SHOULD link to a _Contextual Entity_ or _Data Entity_ in the _RO-Crate Metadata Document_ with a name and description (see section on [licensing](contextual-entities#licensing-access-control-and-copyright)). MAY, if necessary be a textual description of how the RO-Crate may be used. 

{: .note }
> These requirements are stricter than those published 
> for [Google Dataset Search](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/dataset) which 
> requires a `Dataset` to have a `name` and `description`,

{: .warning }
> The properties above are not sufficient to generate a [DataCite][DataCite Schema] citation. Advice on integrating with [DataCite] will be provided in a future version of this specification, or as an implementation guide.

Additional properties of _schema.org_ types [Dataset] and [CreativeWork] MAY be added to further describe the RO-Crate as a whole, e.g. [author], [abstract], [publisher]. See sections [contextual entities](contextual-entities) and [provenance](provenance) for further details.


### Root Data Entity identifier

The root data entity's `@id` SHOULD be either `./` (indicating the directory of `ro-crate-metadata.json` is the [RO-Crate Root](structure)), or an absolute URI.

<!-- NOT NEEDED
If the `@id` of the Root Data Entity is an absolute URI, an _Attached RO-Crate_ MAY contain both [data entities](data-entities) using relative URI references (relative to the _RO-Crate Root_, and [Web-based Data Entities](data-entities.html#web-based-data-entities) using absolute URIs but it is RECOMMENDED that data entities are referenced using absolute URIs.
-->


{: note}
> RO-Crates that have been assigned a _persistent identifier_ (e.g. a DOI) MAY indicate this using [identifier] on the root data entity using the approach set out in the [Science On Schema.org guides], that is through a `PropertyValue` or MAY use a full persistent URL as the `@id` for the _Root Data Entity_.
>
> Earlier RO-Crate 1.1 and earlier recommended `identifier` to be plain string URIs. Clients SHOULD be permissive of an RO-Crate `identifier` being a string (which MAY be a URI), or a `@id` reference, which SHOULD be represented as an `PropertyValue` entity which MUST have a human readable `value`, and SHOULD have a `url` if the identifier is Web-resolvable. A citable representation of this persistent identifier MAY be given as a `description` of the `PropertyValue`, but as there are more than 10.000 known [citation styles], no attempt should be made to parse this string.

#### Resolvable persistent identifiers and citation text

It is RECOMMENDED that resolving the `identifier` programmatically return the _RO-Crate Metadata Document_ or an archive (e.g. ZIP) that contain the _RO-Crate Metadata File_, using [content negotiation](profiles#how-to-retrieve-a-profile-crate) and/or [Signposting]. With an RO-Crate identifier that is persistant and resolvable in this way from a URI, the root data entity SHOULD indicate this using the `cite-as` property according to [RFC8574]. Likewise, an HTTP/HTTPS server of the resolved RO-Crate Metadata Document or archive (possibly after redirection) SHOULD indicate that persistent identifier in its [Signposting] headers using `Link rel="cite-as"`. 

{: .tip}
> The above `cite-as` MAY go to a repository landing page, and MAY require authentication, but MUST ultimately have the RO-Crate as a downloadable item, which SHOULD be programmatically accessible through content negotiation or [Signposting] (`Link rel="describedby"` for a _RO-Crate Metadata Document_, or `Link rel="item"` for an archive). To rather associate a textual scholarly citation for a crate (e.g. journal article), indicate instead a [publication via `citation` property](contextual-entities#publications-via-citation-property).

Any entity which is a subclass of CreativeWork, including the _Root Data Entity_ MAY have a `creditText` property which provides a textual citation for the entity.

## Minimal example of RO-Crate

The following _RO-Crate Metadata Document_ represents a minimal description of an _RO-Crate_ that also follows the identifier recommendations above for use in a _Local RO-Crate Package_.
