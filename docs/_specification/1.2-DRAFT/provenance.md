## Equipment used to create files

To specify which **equipment** was used to create or update a [Data Entity](data-entities), the _RO-Crate JSON-LD_ SHOULD have a _Contextual Entity_ for each item of equipment which SHOULD be of `@type` [IndividualProduct]. The entity SHOULD have a serial number and manufacturer that identify the equipment as completely as possible. In the following case the equipment is a bespoke machine. The equipment SHOULD be described on a web page, and the address of the description SHOULD be used as its `@id`.


```json
{
  "@id": "https://confluence.csiro.au/display/ASL/Hovermap",
  "@type": "IndividualProduct",
  "description": "The CSIRO bentwing is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV, commonly known as a drone) with a LIDAR ... ",
  "identifier": "https://confluence.csiro.au/display/ASL/Hovermap",
  "name": "Bentwing"
}
```


Use the [CreateAction] and [UpdateAction] types to model the contributions of _Contextual Entities_ of type [Person] or [Organization] in the creation of files.

In the example below, the [CreateAction] has a human [agent], the [object] is a [Place] (a cave) and the Hovermap drone is the [instrument] used in the file creation event.


```json
{
  "@id": "#DataCapture_wcc02",
  "@type": "CreateAction",
  "agent": {
    "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1672-552X"
  },
  "instrument": {
    "@id": "https://confluence.csiro.au/display/ASL/Hovermap"
  },
  "object": {
    "@id": "#victoria_arch"
  },
  "result": [
    {
      "@id": "wcc02_arch.laz"
    },
    {
      "@id": "wcc02_arch_traj.txt"
    }
  ]
},
{
    "@id": "#victoria_arch",
    "@type": "Place",
    "address": "Wombeyan Caves, NSW 2580",
    "name": "Victoria Arch"
}
```




## Software used to create files

To specify which software was used to create or update a file, the software application SHOULD be represented with an entity of type [SoftwareApplication], with a [version] property, e.g. from `tool --version`.

For example:

```json
{
      "@id": "https://www.imagemagick.org/",
      "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
      "url": "https://www.imagemagick.org/",
      "name": "ImageMagick",
      "version": "ImageMagick 6.9.7-4 Q16 x86_64 20170114 http://www.imagemagick.org"
}
```

The software SHOULD be associated with the [File]\(s) (or other [data entities](data-entities)) it created as an [instrument] of a [CreateAction], with the [File] referenced by a [result] property. Any input files SHOULD be referenced by the [object] property.

In the below example, an image with the `@id` of `pics/2017-06-11%2012.56.14.jpg` was transformed into an new image `pics/sepia_fence.jpg` using the _ImageMagick_ software application as "instrument". Actions MAY have human-readable names, which MAY be machine generated for use at scale.

```json
{
  "@id": "#Photo_Capture_1",
  "@type": "CreateAction",
  "agent": {
    "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3545-944X"
  },
  "description": "Photo snapped on a photo walk on a misty day",
  "endTime": "2017-06-11T12:56:14+10:00",
  "instrument": [
    {
      "@id": "#EPL1"
    },
    {
      "@id": "#Panny20mm"
    }
  ],
  "result": {
    "@id": "pics/2017-06-11%2012.56.14.jpg"
  }
},
{
  "@id": "#Sepia_Conversion_1",
  "@type": "CreateAction",
  "name": "Convert dog image to sepia",
  "description": "convert -sepia-tone 80% test_data/sample/pics/2017-06-11\\ 12.56.14.jpg test_data/sample/pics/sepia_fence.jpg",
  "endTime": "2018-09-19T17:01:07+10:00",
  "instrument": {
    "@id": "https://www.imagemagick.org/"
  },
  "object": {
    "@id": "pics/2017-06-11%2012.56.14.jpg"
  },
  "result": {
    "@id": "pics/sepia_fence.jpg"
  }
}
```

{% include callout.html type="tip" content="If representing command lines, double escape `\\` so that JSON preserves the `\` character." %}

If multiple [SoftwareApplication]s have been used in composition, such as from a script or workflow, then the `CreateAction`'s [instrument] SHOULD rather reference a [SoftwareSourceCode] which can be further described as explained in the [Workflows and scripts](workflows) section.

## Recording changes to RO-Crates

To record an action which changes an entity's metadata, or changes its state in a publication or other workflow, a [CreateAction] or [UpdateAction] SHOULD be associated with a [Data Entity](data-entities) or, for the RO-Crate itself, with the [root data entity](root-data-entity).

A curation Action MUST have at least one [object] which associates it with either the root data entity `Dataset` or one of its components.

An Action which creates new _Data entities_ - for example, the creation of a new metadata file - SHOULD have these as [result]s.

An Action SHOULD have a [name] and MAY have a [description].

An Action SHOULD have an [endTime], which MUST be in [ISO 8601 date format][DateTime] and SHOULD be specified to at least the precision of a day. An Action MAY have a [startTime] meeting the same specifications.

An Action SHOULD have a human [agent] who was responsible for authorizing the action, and MAY have an [instrument] which associates the action with a particular piece of software (for example, the content management system or data catalogue through which an update was approved) which SHOULD be of `@type` SoftwareApplication.

An Action's status MAY be recorded in an [actionStatus] property. The status must be one of the values enumerated by [ActionStatusType]: [ActiveActionStatus], [CompletedActionStatus], [FailedActionStatus] or [PotentialActionStatus].

An Action which has failed MAY record any error information in an [error] property.

[UpdateAction] SHOULD only be used for actions which affect the Dataset as a whole, such as movement through a workflow.

To record curation actions which modify a [File] within a Dataset - for example, by correcting or enhancing metadata - the old version of the [File] SHOULD be retained, and a [CreateAction] added which has the original version as its [object] and the new version as its [result].

}
```




## Digital Library and Repository content

To describe an export from a Digital Library or repository system, RO-Crate uses the _Portland Common Data Model_ ([PCDM]). 

A [Contextual Entity](contextual-entities) from a repository, representing an abstract entity such as a person, or a work, or a place SHOULD have a `@type` of [RepositoryObject], in addition to any other types. 

Objects MAY be grouped together in [RepositoryCollection]s with [hasMember] pointing to the [RepositoryObject]. 

{% include callout.html type="note" content="The terms `RepositoryObject` and `RepositoryCollection` are renamed in RO-Crate to avoid collision between other vocabularies and the PCDM terms `Collection` and `Object`. The term `RepositoryFile` is renamed to avoid clash with RO-Crate's `File` mapping to <http://schema.org/MediaObject>." %}

{% include callout.html type="warning" content="PCDM specifies that files should have only technical metadata, not descriptive metadata, which is _not_ a restriction in RO-Crate. If the RO-Crate is to be imported into a strict PCDM repository, modeling of object/file relationships will be necessary." %}

For example, this data is exported from an [Omeka] repository:
