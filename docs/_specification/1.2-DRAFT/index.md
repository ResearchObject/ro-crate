excerpt: |
  This document specifies a method, known as RO-Crate (Research Object Crate), of organizing file-based data with associated metadata, using Linked Data principles, in both human and machine readable formats, with the ability to include additional domain-specific metadata.

  The core of RO-Crate is a JSON-LD document, the RO-Crate Metadata Document. This document contains structured metadata about the dataset as a whole and, optionally, about some or all of its data, which may be present as local files or references to data online. The RO-Crate conventions provide a way to, for example, assert the authors (e.g. people, organizations) of the RO-Crate or one its files, or to capture more complex provenance for files, such as how they were created using software and equipment. 

  While providing the formal specification for RO-Crate, this document also aims to be a practical guide for software authors to create tools for generating and consuming research data packages, with explanation by examples.
