The RO-Crate SHOULD contain additional information about _Contextual Entities_ for the use of both humans (in `ro-crate-preview.html`) and machines (in `ro-crate-metadata.json`). This also helps to maximize the extent to which an _RO-Crate_ is self-contained and self-describing, in that it reduces the need for the consumer of an RO-Crate to refer to external information which may change or become unavailable over time.

## Contextual vs Data entities

RO-Crate distinguishes between _contextual entities_ and _data entities_.

**[Data entities](data-entities)** primarily exist in their own right as a file or directory (which may be in the _RO-Crate Root_ directory or downloadable by URL). 

**Contextual entities** however primarily exist outside the digital sphere (e.g. [People](#people), [Places](#places)) or are  conceptual descriptions that primarily exist as metadata, like [GeoCoordinates] and [ContactPoint](#contact-information).

Some contextual entities can also be considered data entities -- for instance the [license](#licensing-access-control-and-copyright) property refers to a [CreativeWork] that can reasonably be downloaded, however a license document is not usually considered as part of research outputs and would therefore typically not be included in [hasPart] on the [root data entity](root-data-entity). 

Likewise, some data entities may also be described as contextual entities, for instance a `File` that is also a [ScholarlyArticle]. In such cases the _contextual data entity_ MUST be described as a single JSON-LD object in the RO-Crate Metadata JSON-LD `@graph` and SHOULD list both relevant data and contextual types in a `@type` array. 

{% include callout.html type="tip" content="Files in the _RO-Crate Root_ are not necessarily data entities -- the [RO-Crate Metadata Descriptor](root-data-entity#ro-crate-metadata-descriptor) is a file in the _RO-Crate Root_, but is considered a _Contextual Entity_ as it is describing the RO-Crate, rather than being part of it. On the other hand, the [Root Data Entity](root-data-entity#root-data-entity) is a data entity within its own metadata file." %}

The RO-Crate Metadata JSON-LD `@graph` MUST NOT list multiple entities with the same `@id`; behaviour of consumers of an RO-Crate encountering multiple entities with the same `@id` is undefined.


## Identifiers for contextual entities

A challenge can be how to assign [identifiers for contextual entities](appendix/jsonld#describing-entities-in-json-ld), that is deciding on their `@id` value.

If an existing permalink (e.g. `https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097`) or other absolute URI (e.g. `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_S._Carberry`) is reasonably unique for that entity, that URI SHOULD be used as identifier for the contextual entity in preference of an identifier local to the RO-Crate (e.g. `#josiah` or `#0fa587c6-4580-4ece-a5df-69af3c5590e3`). 

Care should be taken to not describe two conceptually different contextual entities with the same identifier - e.g. if `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_S._Carberry` is a [Person] it SHOULD NOT also be a [CreativeWork] (although this example is a fictional person!).

Where a related URL exists that may not be unique enough to serve as identifier, it can instead be added to a contextual entity using the property [url].


See the [appendix on JSON-LD identifiers](appendix/jsonld#describing-entities-in-json-ld) for details.


## People

A core principle of Linked Data is to use URIs to identify important entities such as people. The following is the minimum recommended way of representing an [author] of an RO-Crate. The [author] property MAY also be applied to a directory ([Dataset]), a [File] or other [CreativeWork] entities.

```json
{
    "@type": "Dataset",
    "@id": "./",
    "...": "...",
    "author": {"@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8367-6908"}
},
{
    "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8367-6908",
    "@type": "Person",
    "affiliation": "University of Technology Sydney",
    "name": "J. Xuan"
}
```

This uses an [ORCID] to unambiguously identify an author, represented as a _Contextual Entity_ of type [Person].

Note the string _value_ for the organizational affiliation. This SHOULD be improved by also providing a _Contextual Entity_ for the organization (see example below).


## Organizations as values

An [Organization] SHOULD be the value for the [publisher] property of a [Dataset] or [ScholarlyArticle].


```json
{
  "@type": "Dataset",
  "@id": "./",
  "...": "...",
  "publisher": {"@id": "https://ror.org/03f0f6041"}
}

{
  "@id": "https://ror.org/03f0f6041",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "University of Technology Sydney",
  "url": "https://ror.org/03f0f6041"
}
```

An [Organization] SHOULD also be used for a [Person]'s [affiliation] property.

```json
{
  "@type": "Dataset",
  "@id": "./",
  "...": "...",
  "publisher": {"@id": "https://ror.org/03f0f6041"},
  "author": {"@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3545-944X"}
},
{
  "@id": "https://ror.org/03f0f6041",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "University of Technology Sydney"
},
{
  "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3545-944X",
  "@type": "Person",
  "affiliation": {"@id": "https://ror.org/03f0f6041"},
  "email": "peter.sefton@uts.edu.au",
  "name": "Peter Sefton"
}
```


## Contact information

An RO-Crate SHOULD have contact information, using a contextual entity of type [ContactPoint]. Note that in Schema.org [Dataset] does not currently have the corresponding [contactPoint] property, so the contact point would need to be given through a [Person] or [Organization] contextual entity which are related to the Dataset via a [author] or [publisher] property.


```json
{
      "@id": "./",
      "@type": "Dataset",
      "...": "...",
      "author": {"@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6121-5409"}
},
{
      "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6121-5409",
      "@type": "Person",
      "contactPoint": {
        "@id": "mailto:tim.luckett@uts.edu.au"
      },
      "familyName": "Luckett",
      "givenName": "Tim",
      "identifier": "https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6121-5409",
      "name": "Tim Luckett"
},
{
      "@id": "mailto:tim.luckett@uts.edu.au",
      "@type": "ContactPoint",
      "contactType": "customer service",
      "email": "tim.luckett@uts.edu.au",
      "identifier": "tim.luckett@uts.edu.au",
      "url": "https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6121-5409"
}
```



## Publications via citation property

To associate a publication with a dataset the _RO-Crate JSON-LD_ MUST include a URL (for example a DOI URL) as the `@id` of a publication using the [citation] property.

For example:


```json
{
    "@id": "./",
    "@type": "Dataset",
    "...": "...",
    "citation": {"@id": "https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2014.2386282"}
}
```

The publication SHOULD be described further 
as an additional contextual entity of
type [ScholarlyArticle] or [CreativeWork].


```json
{
  "@id": "https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2014.2386282",
  "@type": "ScholarlyArticle",
  "author": [
    {
      "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8367-6908"
    },
    {
      "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0690-4732"
    },
    {
      "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3960-0583"
    },
    {
      "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6953-3986"
    }
  ],
  "identifier": "https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2014.2386282",
  "issn": "2168-2267",
  "name": "Topic Model for Graph Mining",
  "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics",
  "datePublished": "2015",
  "creditText": "J. Xuan, J. Lu, G. Zhang and X. Luo, \"Topic Model for Graph Mining,\" in IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, vol. 45, no. 12, pp. 2792-2803, Dec. 2015, doi: 10.1109/TCYB.2014.2386282. keywords: {Data mining;Chemicals;Hidden Markov models;Inference algorithms;Data models;Vectors;Chemical elements;Graph mining;latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA);topic model;Graph mining;latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA);topic model}"
}
```

[citation] MAY also be used with other data and contextual entities:

```json
{
  "@id": "communities-2018.csv",
  "@type": "File",
  "name": "Snapshot of RO Community efforts",
  "citation": {"@id": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1313066"},
  "encodingFormat": "text/csv"
}
```

A [data entity](data-entities) MAY provide a published DOI [identifier] that primarily captures that file or dataset. A citation MAY also be provided:

```json
{
  "@id": "figure.png",
  "@type": ["File", "ImageObject"],
  "name": "XXL-CT-scan of an XXL Tyrannosaurus rex skull",
  "identifier": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3479743",
  "citation": {"@id": "http://ndt.net/?id=19249"},
  "encodingFormat": "image/png"
},
{
    "@id": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3479743",
    "@type": "PropertyValue",
    "propertyID": "https://registry.identifiers.org/registry/doi",

{
  "@id": "http://ndt.net/?id=19249",
  "@type": "ScholarlyArticle",
  "url": "http://ndt.net/?id=19249",
  "name": "An XXL-CT-scan of an XXL Tyrannosaurus rex skull. 19th World Conference on Non-Destructive Testing (WCNDT 2016)",
  "creditText": "Reims, N., Schulp, A., Böhnel, M., & Larson, P. (2016).

}


```


## Publisher

The [Root Data Entity](root-data-entity) SHOULD have a [publisher] property. This SHOULD be an [Organization] though it MAY be a [Person].


```json
{
  "@id": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1009240",
  "@type": "Dataset",
  "name": "Sample dataset for RO-Crate v0.2",
  "publisher": {
    "@id": "https://ror.org/03f0f6041"
  },
  "temporalCoverage": "2017"
},

{
  "@id": "https://ror.org/03f0f6041",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "identifier": "https://ror.org/03f0f6041",
  "name": "University of Technology Sydney"
},
```





## Funding and grants

To associate a research project with a [Dataset], the _RO-Crate JSON-LD_ SHOULD contain an entity for the project using type [Organization], referenced by a [funder] property. The project `Organization` SHOULD in turn reference any external [funder], either by using its URL as an `@id` or via a _Contextual Entity_ describing the funder.

{% include callout.html type="tip" content="To make it very clear where funding is coming from, the _Root Data Entity_ SHOULD also reference funders directly, as well as via a chain of references." %}


```json
{
  "@id": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1009240",
  "@type": "Dataset",
  "funder": {
    "@id": "https://ror.org/038sjwq14"
  },
},
{
  "@id": "https://eresearch.uts.edu.au/projects/provisioner",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "description": "The University of Technology Sydney Provisioner project is ...",
  "funder": [
    {
      "@id": "https://ror.org/03f0f6041"
    },
    {
      "@id": "https://ands.org.au"
    }
  ],
  "identifier": "https://eresearch.uts.edu.au/projects/provisioner",
  "name": "Provisioner"
},
{
  "@id": "https://ror.org/03f0f6041",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "identifier": "https://ror.org/03f0f6041",
  "name": "University of Technology Sydney"
},
{
  "@id": "https://ands.org.au",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "description": "The core purpose of the Australian National Data Service (ANDS) is ...",
  "identifier": "https://ands.org.au",
  "name": "Australian National Data Service"
},
```



## Licensing, Access control and copyright

If a [Data Entity](data-entities) has a [license] that is different from the license on the _Root Data Entity_, the entity SHOULD have a [license] property referencing a _Contextual Entity_ with a type [CreativeWork] to describe the license. The `@id` of the license SHOULD be its URL (e.g. a Creative Commons License URL) and, when possible, a summary of the license included using the [description] property.

The below _Data Entity_ has a [copyrightHolder] which is different from its [author]. There is a reference to an [Organization] describing the copyright holder and, to give credit, a [sameAs] relation to a web page. The [license] property here refers to <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/> which is expanded in a separate contextual entity.


```json
{
  "@id": "SciDataCon Presentations/AAA_Pilot_Project_Abstract.html",
  "@type": "File",
  "contentSize": "17085",
  "copyrightHolder": {
    "@id": "https://www.idrc.ca/"
  },
  "author": {
    "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0068-716X"
  },
  "description": "Abstract for the Pilot Project initial findings",
  "encodingFormat": "text/html",
  "license": {
    "@id": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"
  },
  "sameAs": "https://www.scidatacon.org/2016/sessions/56/paper/265/"
},

{
  "@id": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",
  "@type": "CreativeWork",
  "name": "CC BY 4.0",

  "@type": "Organization",
  "description": "Canadian Frown Corporation and funder of development research",
  "identifier": "IDRC",
  "name": "International Development Research Center"
}
```


### Metadata license

In some cases the license of the [RO-Crate metadata](root-data-entity) (the JSON-LD statements in the _RO-Crate Metadata Descriptor_) is different from the license on the [Root Data Entity](root-data-entity) and its content (_data entities_ indicated by [hasPart]). 

For instance, a common pattern for repositories is to license metadata as [CC0 Public Domain Dedication][CC0], while data is licensed as [CC-BY] or similar.  This pattern allow metadata to be combined freely (e.g. the [DataCite] knowledge graph), while redistribution of data files would require explicit attribution and statement of their license.

To express the metadata license is different from the _Root Data Entity_, expand the _RO-Crate Metadata Descriptor_  to include `license`:

```json
{
  "@type": "CreativeWork",
  "@id": "ro-crate-metadata.json",
  "identifier": "ro-crate-metadata.json",
  "about": {"@id": "./"},
  "license": {
    "@id": "https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"
  }
},

{
  "@id": "./",
  "@type": "Dataset",
  "...": "...",
  "license": {
    "@id": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"
  }
}

```

If no explicit `license` is expressed on the _RO-Crate Metadata Descriptor_, the `license` expressed on the _Root Data Entity_ applies also on the RO-Crate metadata.


## Extra metadata such as Exif

Schema.org has a generic extension mechanism for encoding arbitrary properties and values which are not available as Schema.org properties. An example of this is the Schema.org [recommended way (see example 2)][ImageObject] of including [Exif] technical image metadata.

To include EXIF, or other data which can be encoded as property/value pairs, add an array of references to _Anonymous Entities_ which encode each property. This example shows one property of several hundred.

```json
{
      "@id": "pics/2017-06-11%2012.56.14.jpg",
      "@type": ["File", "ImageObject"],
      "contentSize": "5114778",
      "author": {
        "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3545-944X"
      },
      "description": "Depicts a fence at a disused motor racing venue with the front part of a slightly out of focus black dog in the foreground.",
      "encodingFormat": "image/jpeg",
      "exifData": [
        {
          "@id": "#2eb90b09-a8b8-4946-805b-8cba077a7137"
        },
        {
          "@id": "#c2521494-9b94-4b23-a713-6b281f540823"
        },
      ]
},
{
      "@id": "#c2521494-9b94-4b23-a713-6b281f540823",
      "@type": "PropertyValue",
      "name": "InternalSerialNumber",
      "value": "4102011002108002"
},
```


## Places

To associate a [Data Entity](data-entities) with a _Contextual Entity_ representing a geographical location or region, the entity SHOULD have a property of [contentLocation] or [spatialCoverage] with a value of type [Place].

To express point or shape geometry it is recommended that a `geo` property on a [Place] entity SHOULD link to a [Geometry] entity, with an [asWKT] property that expresses the point or shape in [Well Known Text (WKT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) format.  This example is a point, `POINT ($longitude, $latitude)`, but other asWKT primitives, `LINESTRING` & `POLYGON` SHOULD be used as required.

This example shows how to define a place, using a [geonames] ID:


```json
{
  "@id": "./",
  "@type": "Dataset",
  "...": "...",
  "outputOf": "RO-Crate",
  "contact": {
    "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3545-944X"
  },
  "contentLocation": {
    "@id": "http://sws.geonames.org/8152662/",
  }
},
{
  "@id": "http://sws.geonames.org/8152662/",
  "@type": "Place",
  "description": "Catalina Park is a disused motor racing venue, located at Katoomba ...",
  "geo": {
    "@id": "_:Geometry-1"
  },
  "identifier": "http://sws.geonames.org/8152662/",
  "uri": "https://www.geonames.org/8152662/catalina-park.html",
  "name": "Catalina Park"
},
{
  "@id": "_:Geometry-1",
  "@type": "Geometry",
  "name": "Geometry-1",
  "asWKT": "<http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84> POINT (150.301195 -33.7152)"
}
```

{% include callout.html type="tip" content='To find the `@id` and `identifier` corresponding to a GeoNames HTML page like <https://www.geonames.org/8152662/catalina-park.html>, click its `.rdf` button to download the RDF metadata (<https://sws.geonames.org/8152662/about.rdf>). In the RDF metadata, find the line that looks like the following: 
`<gn:Feature rdf:about="http://sws.geonames.org/8152662/">`. The part in the quotes is the identifier (in this case, <http://sws.geonames.org/8152662/>) .
' %}

{% include callout.html type="tip" content="Note the use of a JSON-LD [blank node](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-blank-node) identifier here (starting with `_:`) - this indicates to an RO-Crate presentation application that the entity does not stand in its own right, and may be displayed inline (in this case as a map)." %}

{% include callout.html type="tip" content="It is considered best practice to include the explicit mentioning of the CRS (Coordinate Reference System) identified through its opengis URI at the start of the `asWKT` field.  This provides the essential context to have the numbers in the remainder of the string correctly be plotted on the map.  Note, however, that many GIS related tools expect that information to be fed in via a separate configuration setting or API call. Handling these strings in any app that interacts with such systems might therefore require some extra processing." %}

{% include callout.html type="note" content="Any of the schema.org geographical classes and entities MAY be used on a [Place] element to describe geographical points and shapes, and previous versions of this specification did show examples of using [latitude] and [longitude] properties and entities such as [GeoCoordinates]. However, this results in very verbose JSON-LD, and there is some imprecision in the Schema.org specification that makes this approach hard to implement in applications for analysis or presentation of RO-Crates. We found that developers were resorting to embedding escaped [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) as string values in RO-Crate; instead of this, WKT format is more compact and easier to implement and is recommended for use in RO-Crate as shown above." %}
 
## Subjects & keywords

Subject properties (equivalent to a [Dublin Core Subject](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/terms/subject/)) on the [root data entity](root-data-entity) or a [data entity](data-entities) MUST use the [about] property.

Keyword properties MUST use [keywords]. Note that by Schema.org convention, keywords are given as a single JSON string, with individual keywords separated by commas.

```json
{
  "keywords": "Gibraltar, Spain, British Overseas Territory, city, map",
  "about": { "@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibraltar" },
}
```

## Time

To describe the _time period_ which an RO-Crate [Data Entity](data-entities) (or the [root data entity](root-data-entity)) is _about_, use [temporalCoverage]:

```json
{
  "@id": "photos/",
  "@type": "Dataset",
  "name": "Photos of Gibraltar from 1950 till 1975",
  "about": {"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibraltar"},
  "temporalCoverage": "1950/1975"
}
```


## Thumbnails

A [File] or any other entity MAY have a [thumbnail] property which references another file.

For example, the below [RepositoryObject] is related to four files which are all versions of the same image (via [hasFile]), one of which is a thumbnail. The thumbnail MUST be included in the RO-Crate.

If [thumbnail]s are incidental to the data set, they need not be referenced by [hasPart]  or [hasFile] relationships, but they must be in the BagIt manifest if in a [_Bagged RO-Crate_](appendix/implementation-notes#adding-ro-crate-to-bagit).
