## Programming with JSON-LD

When implementing tools to work with RO-Crate it is not necessary to use JSON-LD software libraries, however, programmers should keep in mind the following:

- **_RO-Crate JSON-lD_ has a flat structure**; every entity is a JSON object directly within the `@graph` array in the _RO-Crate Metadata Document_. A useful strategy when processing a crate is to build a look-up table and/or function so that entities can be found via their ID, for example provide a method such as `getEntity(id)` which returns an entity by its id or a `null` value if it's not there.

- **Code defensively**. Code should not assume that values will always be a String; values for properties may be single scalar values such as strings or integers (`"2"` or 2), or references to other entities such as `{"@id", "_:1"}` (where the referenced entity may or may not be described in the crate, see the point above about having a `getEntity()` method).

- **Read the *whole* specification**. The RO-Crate specification addresses  common use cases individually, introducing aspects of the specification as in a progressive manner. Some key points, such as _entities may have more than one value for `@type`_, may not be apparent from a quick reading.


## Combining with other packaging schemes

RO-Crates may co-exist with other packaging schemes, such as [BagIt] using two general approaches; either (a) _adding_ RO-Crate into a package as part of the payload or (b) _wrapping_ another kind of package. Examples using BagIt follow.

BagIt is described in [RFC 8493]:

> [BagIt is] ... a set of hierarchical file layout conventions
> for storage and transfer of arbitrary digital content. A "bag" has just enough
> structure to enclose descriptive metadata "tags" and a file "payload" but does
> not require knowledge of the payload's internal semantics. This BagIt format
> is suitable for reliable storage and transfer.

BagIt and RO-Crate have largely separate concerns - RO-Crate is focussed on rich
metadata, the semantics of data, while BagIt is about reliable transfer.

### Adding RO-Crate to Bagit

RO-Crate can be combined with BagIt simply by placing the RO-Crate files 
within the BagIt payload (`data/`) directory.

```
<BagIt base directory>/
  |   bagit.txt                 # As per BagIt specification
  |   bag-info.txt              # As per BagIt specification
  |   manifest-<algorithm>.txt  # As per BagIt specification
  |   fetch.txt                 # Optional, per BagIt Specification
  |   data/                     # Payload: RO-Crate root directory
      |   ro-crate-metadata.json           # RO-Crate Metadata File MUST be present
      |   ro-crate-preview.html            # RO-Crate Website homepage MAY be present
      |   ro-crate-preview_files/          # MAY be present
      |   [payload files and directories]  # 1 or more SHOULD be present
```

The [Bag declaration](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8493.html#section-2.1.1) `bagit.txt` MUST be present, the main role of this file is to mark the folder as a bag according to [RFC8493](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8493.html). The file SHOULD have this fixed content in UTF-8:

```
BagIt-version: 1.0
Tag-File-Character-Encoding: UTF-8
```

The _BagIt base directory_ containing `bagit.txt` can have any name, and can be archived/transferred in any way, e.g.  within a ZIP archive, SFTP or even be exposed on the web.

The manifest file contains file checksums; the BagIt specifications [recommends SHA-512](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8493.html#section-2.4) as default algorithm, that is `manifest-sha512.txt` SHOULD be present. 

The BagIt manifest file MUST list the checksum of _all_ payload files in `data/` and its subdirectories. Where `data/` is also the [RO-Crate Root](../structure) the manifest therefore MUST include `ro-crate-metadata.json`:

```
41846747…ee71  data/ro-crate-metadata.json
e1105ed0…5e13  data/chipseq_20200910.json
37fd3a02…bb95  data/results/pipeline_info/design_reads.csv
```

{% include callout.html type="note" content="The SHA-512 checksums have been shortened in the above example." %}

Creating the manifest file without using BagIt tools/libraries can be done using the equivalent of:

```sh
$ find data -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sha512sum > manifest-sha512.txt
```

Similarly checking the payload directory:

```sh
$ sha512sum --quiet -c manifest-sha512.txt
data/chipseq_20200910.json: FAILED
data/ro-crate-metadata.json: FAILED
sha512sum: WARNING: 2 computed checksums did NOT match
```

The BagIt manifest complements the [RO-Crate structure](../structure) as 
it provide a complete listing of all payload files with
cryptographically strong checksums, ensuring the crate has been fully 
archived/transferred, which the weak CRC-32 checksum (TCP/IP,
ZIP, gzip) is insufficient to guarantee, particularly for large crates. 

To ensure the manifest file itself is complete, it is RECOMMENDED to include its 
checksum in `tagmanifest-sha512.txt`:

```
b0556450…8802  bag-info.txt
000b27e3…c52e  manifest-sha512.txt
```

{% include callout.html type="warning" content='The BagIt manifest is intended to detect "bit rot" and accidental damage,
it does not provide proof the RO-Crate has not been deliberately
tampered with, as a malicious actor can also update the checksums.' %}

Guarding against such scenarious would require additional cryptographic
measures, e.g.  
`gpg --detach-sign --armor --output tagmanifest-sha512.txt.asc tagmanifest-sha512.txt`
in combination with a secure PGP key exchange or equivalent trust network.

#### Base URI in BagIt

The arcp specification suggests how [BagIt UUID identifiers] can be used to calculate the base URI of a bag, see section [Establishing a base URI inside a ZIP file](relative-uris#establishing-a-base-uri-inside-a-zip-file).  For this purpose it is RECOMMENDED that `bag-info.txt` includes a fresh UUID like:

    External-Identifier: urn:uuid:24e51ca2-5067-4598-935a-dac4e327d05a


#### Referencing external files

The [BagIt fetch file](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8493.html#section-2.2.3) MAY
be used to reference files to be downloaded into particular `data/` paths
to _complete_ the bag.  These files may be large, require authentication or otherwise
inconvenient to transfer within the BagIt folder.

Example `fetch.txt` using [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/):

```
https://media.githubusercontent.com/…/SPT5_INPUT_R1.bigWig 963489 data/results/SPT5_INPUT_R1.bigWig
```

BagIt tools can help complete the bag and verify the checksum of the downloaded
files according to the manifest.

The RO-Crate contained in `data/` MAY describe the bag with 
[data entities](../data-entities#embedded-data-entities-that-are-also-on-the-web)
as if the bag was _complete_, even if the large file is not (yet) present:

```json
  {
    "@id": "results/SPT5_INPUT_R1.bigWig",
    "@type": "File",
    "name": "Normalized SPT5_INPUT_R1 bigWig for genome browsers",
    "encodingFormat": {"@id": "http://edamontology.org/format_3006"},
    "url": "https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/biocompute-objects/bco-ro-example-chipseq/main/data/results/bwa/mergedLibrary/bigwig/SPT5_INPUT_R1.bigWig"}
  }
```

It is RECOMMENDED that the `url` is provided in the data entity
and consistent with the line in `fetch.txt` in case the RO-Crate 
is transferred outside its BagIt container.

The `fetch.txt` approach can also be useful where other files in the RO-Crate
reference a downloadable file by relative paths within `data/`, even if 
this file is not itself described in the RO-Crate metadata.


#### Snapshots of external files

As an alternative to the above, [web-based data entities](../data-entities#web-based-data-entities)
can be used in the RO-Crate:

```json
  {
    "@id": "https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/biocompute-objects/bco-ro-example-chipseq/main/data/results/bwa/mergedLibrary/bigwig/SPT5_INPUT_R1.bigWig",
    "@type": "File",
    "name": "Normalized SPT5_INPUT_R1 bigWig for genome browsers",
    "encodingFormat": {"@id": "http://edamontology.org/format_3006"}
  }
```

The above data entity MAY be combined with `fetch.txt` in the BagIt base directory:

```
https://media.githubusercontent.com/…/SPT5_INPUT_R1.bigWig 963489 data/snapshots/SPT5_INPUT_R1.bigWig
```

In this case the file `data/snapshots/SPT5_INPUT_R1.bigWig` may be present,
but unknown by RO-Crate; BagIt contains a checksummed snapshot of the 
web resource. Compared with the first approach, the RO-Crate is here 
primarily pointing at a web resource which is allowed to change
without causing a BagIt checksum error.


### Example of wrapping a BagIt bag in an RO-Crate

Alternatively, an RO-Crate can _wrap_ a BagIt bag, so that the RO-Crate metadata
is outside of the bag directory and can be changed without changing the payload's checksums. 

```
<RO-Crate root directory>/
  |   ro-crate-metadata.json    # RO-Crate Metadata File MUST be present
  |   ro-crate-preview.html     # RO-Crate Website homepage MAY be present
  |   ro-crate-preview_files/   # MAY be present
  |   bag1/                     # "Wrapped" bag - could have any name
  |      bagit.txt                 # As per BagIt specification
  |      bag-info.txt              # As per BagIt specification
  |      manifest-<algorithm>.txt  # As per BagIt specification
  |      fetch.txt                 # Optional, per BagIt Specification
  |      data/
  |         [payload files and directories]  # 1 or more SHOULD be present
  |         example.txt 
```

A [Data Entity](../data-entities) describing `example.txt` in this scenario would have an `@id` of `bag1/data/example.txt`:

```json
{
  "@id": "bag1/data/example.txt",
  "name": "Example file"
}
```


## Repository-specific identifiers

_Root Data Entities_ MAY include repository-specific identifiers, described using [Contextual Entities](../contextual-entities) using a [PropertyValue], with a [name] that identifies the repository and the [identifier] as a value. The _same_ identifier MAY be used in multiple different repositories and effectively namespaced using the `name` of the `ProperyValue`.

```json
{
  "@id": "./",
  "@type": "Dataset",
  "identifier": ["https://doi.org/10.4225/59/59672c09f4a4b", {"@id": "_:localid:my-repo:my-id"}, {"@id": "_:localid:other-repo:https://doi.org/10.4225/59/59672c09f4a4b"}]
}

 {
   "@id": "_:localid:my-repo:my-id",
   "@type": "PropertyValue",
   "name": "my-repo",
   "value": "my-id"
 }

  {
   "@id": "_:localid:other-repo:https://doi.org/10.4225/59/59672c09f4a4b",
   "@type": "PropertyValue",
   "name": "other-repo",
   "value": "https://doi.org/10.4225/59/59672c09f4a4b"
 }
```
