# APPENDIX: Changelog {#changelog}

* RO-Crate 1.2.0
  * Clarified that the [RO-Crate Metadata Descriptor MUST have `@id` of `ro-crate-metadata.json`](../root-data-entity#ro-crate-metadata-descriptor) by removing conflicting statements elsewhere in the specification [#365](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/pull/365)
  * Updated the Bioschemas namespace for properties from `https://bioschemas.org/ComputationalWorkflow#` to `https://bioschemas.org/properties/`. This change affects only the `input` and `output` properties in the [JSON-LD context](../ro-crate-metadata.json).

 (see [algorithm](../root-data-entity#finding-the-root-data-entity))
