# Introducing the RO-Crate blog

This is the first post in a new section on the RO-Crate website: a [blog]({{baseurl}}{% link pages/community/blog.md %}). Here we will post news and announcements relevant to the RO-Crate community, as well as occasional developer blogs and articles written by members of the community. 

You can find the blog section by going to the "Community" page from the navigation bar, then clicking "Blog" in the sidebar.

If you'd like to contribute a post to the blog, or you have news you want to share with the community, please [contact us]({{baseurl}}{% link pages/community/community.md %}#contact-us)!

You could write about:
* how you're using RO-Crate in your project or domain
* an event you attended where RO-Crate was mentioned
* a tool you've created for handling RO-Crates
* an idea you've been exploring and want to share.

## How to contribute

See the [template](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/blob/main/docs/_posts/.template.md) for guidance on contributing a post to the blog.
